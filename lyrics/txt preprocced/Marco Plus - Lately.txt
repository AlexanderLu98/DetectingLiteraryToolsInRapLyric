4 ContributorsLately Lyrics[Verse: 1]
I spent my whole life chasing the same thing, I can't change
It's difficult, healthy mind state but pain is physical
I'm from the Southside where danger's typical
They aim to get at you, bang the blick at you and rain the clip at you
I keep a hoodie on my noggin, and a fully loaded Glock up in it
Bully on me I pop em with it, I pull it, dome 'em and dodge conviction
Learned early niggas don't play by the rules so stay by ya tool
I seen niggas skate out of school just ducking the fade
Can't fight so they clutching the gauge
Instead of taking a snuff in the face they just bust it with rage
No tussle just spray, the situation fuckеd to this day
Got nigga, S that's younger than Tre out herе bustin the tray
5'7" and under, fire weapons like thunder
Do the children who die ever find heaven I wonder (I swear to god)
Shit is rough out here
But don't nobody give a fuck out here, better be tough out here, uh

[Chorus]
Lately I been trippin, uh
Lately I been trippin out
Lately I been slipping, uh
Lately I been flipping out
Lately I been lifted, uh
Hazy mind been drifting wild
Crazy, time been ticking, uh
This phase so hard to figure out

[Verse: 2]
Aye, keep the drama over there
Before all my n* *s leave some trauma in the air
We sneaking llamas up in here
Black panther in the booth, Fred Hampton picked my suit
And then I smoked a spliff with Huey and Queen Assata did my hair
Yo team silent, we the livest up in here
So keep quiet cuz I speak knowledge but I preach violence up in here
Fear the criminal, revere the general, this here's the pinnacle
And you won't hear subliminals when I'm dissing you
I'm clipping you and ya niggas too
Shots through ya oculus dog, I got em I'm positive
All you opp niggas closeted
But I'll lock you in closets then get the chopper and let lava spit
Charizard when I'm poppin shit
Ball hard I'm Ben Wallace with bars
Shots through ya Honda Accord
I ordered a hit while I was out and abroad
I send a cop to the lord, then stick my cock in his broad
Here we go again, the frozen skin coldest soul within
Big dog, nigga, a real doberman but
[Chorus]
Lately I been trippin, uh

[Verse: 3]
Okay, my dog can't smoke no weed, I smoke enough for both of us
My partner just OD'd, I toke it up to cope with stuff
Lil' shawty don't know me, just know enough to roll with us
I'm tryna be lowkey, she blow me up just posting stuff
I'm trying not to get killed, that hoe out here making it hard
She don't know that shit real, that hoe I just gave em' the drop
No bolts tryna hit drills, they don't know I came with a Glock
Move wrong and I'm making a pop
Might blow out my way with a shot
Lil bro out here chasin' some guap, so bro out here making 'em shop
He see them blue lights and now he boltin' away from the cops
Won't catch him fatin' the opp's, It's on when he aim for the box
Wrong place, wrong time
And now lil bro out here takin' ya watch
Life is like plotho or plomo, so I'm riding wit' a nine, that's either rondo or romo
I fight this war all by myself call me Han bitch I'm Solo
They can't find me, I been hiding, I'm just vibin' I'm so low, uh
[Chorus]
Lately I been trippin, uh
Lately I been trippin out
Lately I been slipping, uh
Lately I been flipping out
Lately I been lifted, uh
Hazy mind been drifting wild
Crazy, time been ticking, uh
This phase so hard to figure out

Lately I been trippin, uh
Lately I been trippin out
Lately I been slipping, uh
Lately I been flipping out
Lately I been lifted, uh
Hazy mind been drifting wild
Crazy, time been ticking, uh
