[1st Verse] (Russell The First)
Russell tell'em first
Larger life goals bringing dreams home all the way to the top
Ready to roll like a dice run it so nicely we got it on lock
My flow just slaps so hard like I'm "George" nigga take measures  before you approach
I got the juice got sauce shawty so bad she gon' fuck up a bag
Russell the first in the building no room for haters running after me? that's stupid
Shut the fuck up if you hate me I don't give a dem rate or hate follow or go missing
Legendary shit they don't wanna blink afraid you gon' miss it nigga take a sit
I ride the beat like a jet ski way too legit I'm too wavy
Don't try to sleep me you, gon' regret it this ain't no joke
Bitch ass nigga still snitching yea these niggas keep  acting  like hoes
Haters gon' talk shit haters gon' hate cause they nothing more than plastic they fake
I ain't giving no attention to no haters they nothing more than plastic they fake

[2nd Verse] (Lowky)
Lowky rap Demon
I run up a bag
So nigga are tranna get mad at me
Pay them no mind
Cause when they hatin is just when I happen to win
They extrapolate my movements
It's a shame I keep changing my game
Making mega moves men
For your loss you ghat yourself to blame
Rock,paper, scissors
Lowky, money, bitch
Just follow the sequence
I don't deal with them snitches
They say more money more problems
I say no money no honey
I rather be counting hundreds
Than be worried bout them problems
Ndalama mu mutu kwati nagona mu BOZ
Kaku pita kwati sefa inama holes
My cash flow flowing like eminem's flow
I'm a ticking bomb and I'm bout to blow
You can't stand me until you understand me
You think you know me well you know nothing
I'm in hustle mode you can see action
If you run a bag then you know what I mean

[3rd Verse] (Russell The First)
You think you tuff you play with me you know what's up, slap the shit out a nigga yea how's that?
No I don't promote violence I put you
In place so you don't wanna mess up
I'ma live in the future I'm  predicting now keep it one  hunnid secure the bag
Ain't gotta cap you don't stand no chance when I shoot my shot nigga take a nap
I know they waiting on me to fall, you gotta be patient my nigga hold
I just got your hopes high though, forget cause this won't happen bro
I'ma keep working hard so they gon' say I earned it and clear doubts for that guy Thomas
You one of 'em niggas who doubted me acting funny get the fuck out the scene
Wanna make me some racks take a sit and relax and it turns out no time for  that bitch
I'ma get what I want when I want it I got it now y'all niggas felling the heat
They say competition buh no I don't see it tell'em to stop playing with me
Put up a petition buh still you gon' lose it nigga tryna fit in the league ha!Embed
