22 ContributorsFire in the Booth Lyrics[Possessed]:
All systems go, I'm not skin and bone
I'm living stone like the creature from Ninja Scroll
Death kiss under the mistletoe
Not down from day one?
Rest assured you missed the boat
Welcome to Interzone, drop gems
This is the Jewel in the Crown of my Crystal Skull
Malignant growth formed in my brain
Price of receiving prophecies from Indrid Cold
I'm anathema, different strokes for different folks
But when I rap you'll all have a seizure
Relieve my thoughts of the cabin fever
Opening my cranium, no anesthesia
Ectomorph, move with excessive force
Smugglin' seven sins through heaven's door
Devil spawn, inherently evil
Drank RedBull and then grew a set of horns
Lyricism forevermore, the man with two brains
Yet I never have second thoughts
Don't think twice represent the raw
Death don't come in threes, it comes in metaphors
I don't come in peace, come with a nuclear device handcuffed to me
Don't fuck with me, R.A. don't fuck with me
R.A. don't... what
You might also like[Skirmish]:
Comin' for blood, no need duckin' your punch
Cuz I'll catch your thrown fist
Crush your knucles to dust, and
Fuckin' with us you get impaled on a hook
Got no leg to stand on, you shot yourself in the foot
I'm mentally sick in the mind
Tell the judge it ain’t me they just keep running into the knife
A hired hitman, scopin' you
With infrared laser beams: lock, load and shoot
A secret society of a chosen few
With home-made explosives in soles of shoes
And I'm scratchin' the flesh
Off of the back of my heads
Where I want the barcode removed
The lost twin of the son of Jor-El
Bullets from loaded pistols couldn't puncture my shell
Nor exploding missiles, never drew blood from myself
R.A. put you under a spell, yeah

[Psiklone]:
Yo, I keep my eyes peeled with hunting knives
My voice alone provokes stone gargoyles to come to life
I gave nightmares spitting Lucifer lullabies
Tried a hundred times but can't seem to 'ucking die
Run and hide
When disaster strikes, the whole world's looking at me like Busta Rhymes
Turn the London eye colour-blind
Muscles thrive off natural steroids in my blood supply
Psiklone, that sick psycho
Drink and spit nitro and sprint so quick I switch time zones
Bury my landlords under the floor
When lightning strikes I hit back with double the force
Death sentences riddled with wise words
Like the Titanic you've only touched the tip of the iceberg
Grab minotaurs by the horns
I’m a higher force, learnt to fly before I could walk
The genesis of metaphysics
Never week, I created god in less than seven minutes
R.A. stretch the limit
Doctors are still counting my IQ's never-ending digits
Appear from barrels of gun smoke
My poison pen's ink is the blood of Marilyn Monroe
License to drive you insane
Never lost my voice, but sometimes it tries to escape
Soul Reaver without a heart
Premature, tore myself from the womb and spat out thousand bars
Balthazar's demonic counterpart
I'm blowing marble temples down like a house of cards
Bring your reinforcements
A mind so great I'm trapped in this body like Steven Hawking
Drawn by evil forces
I've been to hell and back… and then collapsed from heat exhaustion
Rhyme Asylum, that's what's up
[Possessed]:
Son of a pump action, when I start to spit
Scars from whips appear from my tongue-lashing
Darkness lives, midnight feast
Raid Jeffrey Dahmer's fridge for left-over carcasses
R.A. wordsmith
Want author of the King James version in flames burnin'
Insane brain surgeons
Operate with chainsaws; malpractice makes perfect
Fingers crossed for my Hippocratic Oath
My anecdote sent you tumbling down a rabbit hole
Kidnap that which matters most
Ransom notes demand Zion mainframe access codes
Bag of bones, hollow-eyed
Escalatin' Karmic debt, livin' off of borrowed time
Twist the words of the righteous
Lost my mind, God help the person that finds it
Won't compromise, 100 proof drunken fist
Suicide techniques dominate my bucket list
Not an MC I'm a WMD
Patience depleted I'm running on empty
Remorseless, living corpses
Walking in dead man's Air Forces
Upper lip in a state of rigor mortis
Atheist till the grave, word to Richard Dawkins
[Psiklone]:
Yo, psychiatric patients
Our imagination's gravitating towards a morbid fascination
Murder mics, spat my first verse at the birth of Christ
And the plains of Hell turned to ice
Sneeze hospital super bugs
Dive to the bottom of your gene pool just to remove the plug
One eyed pirate, ring of fire from my iris
My incisors the size of Bengali tigers'
Rhyme Asylum, turn the mics up and kill the silence
Turn the lights off and feel the violence
Mister Samsa, lucid dreaming
My first metamorphosis turned me into a human being
I'll change your life in under a hundred bars
Like diamorphine we're going up in arms
Sticks and stones can't break my bones
And when it comes to words, you don't stand a fucking chance

[Skirmish]:
RA connects with the best in the west coast
Visited by an escape convict from death row
Murderous dressed in a trench coat
After killings, my trademark for death is a red rose
Living legend even if I happen to die
Cos best rapper alive will be etched on my headstone
Lusting blood, as my mouth salivates
We coming up, every underdog has its day
Muzzles off, and all love is lost
So I have to play my part in acts of hate
Decapitate you as you gasp for breath
Cost you an arm and leg to pay your last respects
And if you’re nobody ‘till somebody kills you
I’m ready to die and live a life after death

[Possessed]:
Brace yourself, my basement contains conveyor-belts
Leading corpses to the gates of Hell
Human ears hang from my dog-tags
Sharp off the top like Oddjob's hat
When I come off the head, heads come off the neck
I'm pulling your leg, off at the quadricep
So watch your step, known veteran
Gave Doctor Death a taste of his own medicine
Pain Olympics gold medalist
Go against my wishes, I incinerate my bridges
Paganistic, pray to a graven image
Raise the spirits of Salem witches
This is devil worship, consume vestal virgins
To keep the fire in my belly burning
Count wolves instead of sheep to get to sleep
Immortal, resisting a-rest in peace
[Skirmish]:
Break your bones with built in brass knuckles
N.O.S cylinders inside my legs as calf muscles
Sprint against an avalanche
Souls expire, exposed to the smokeless fire of this dragon’s wrath
Tarot cards, dealt death in every pack
Thought in my mind racing completing memory lapse
Would suffocate to death if I swallowed my pride
My heart attacks in battles between body and mind
The earth rumbles and quakes at my coming of age
An appetite for destruction stepping up to the plate
My skin's senseless to cigarette burns
Coz I’m charged on an overdose of Nilapat herbs
And I...
(Inhale) I love the smell of death in the air
In the midst of war holding my severed head by the hair
I’m never level headed, an unbalanced mind
That sent my pulsating heart and dead roses to my valentine3Embed
