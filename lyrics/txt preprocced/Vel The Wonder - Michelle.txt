2 ContributorsMichelle Lyrics[Verse: Vel The Wonder]
I drop a buster on his forehead
I am solo on my team, I am more than
This the miseducation of my core fan
I am total mayhem, I am Lauren
Big hook Bianca bussin’, fussin’ a lot
Brianna beating on these bitches with a Bus on her top
Beatrice a busy bone buzzin’ to top
Baby Brenda had a boy like she fuckin’ a lot
On my mama, I am appeased to feed the drama
Dalai Lama, let me find my peace or sayonara
Michelle Obama, I will feed the kids what I can offer
Let yo bitch step to me if she want proper
I mean some pressure, temp is rising, no need to measure
My rendition of heaven exceeds the pleasure
I am always on time, I can’t be the never
I am Hell on Earth, I can be forever
One time, one time for the Hot Girl
I can tell you in a second what you not, girl
I think you bettin’ on a lot, boy
Block toys, I'ma have to knock you from the top, boy
Bangin’ bodies, painted mammy's who like to make some money
Raise her honey, pretty bones who out to face the funny
I can see what really makes them hungry
You tryna intervene on my scene, wanna take it from me?
You might also like[Chorus]
You know I’m speakin’ from the art
Not throwing shit at the wall and hopin’
You know I’m bleedin’ from the start
I got ’em all pissed off and I’m in the open, hopeless
Still rackin’ mines like I stole shit
Still outta time like I won't quit
Still receiving texts from my old bitch
Still removing hexes from an old witch

[Verse: Zoodeville]
Oh shit, Vel done emptied out the whole clip
Aiming at your head now you don’t know shit
All yo shit, nope, my shit dope like a coke sniff
Ran into some problems and some mo’ shit
And I’ve been dope since
You wanna throw shade or throw fits, talk shit
Stain yo whole fit, all you rappers on some hoe shit
Not the ones you wanna go against
It's aight I know you dumb you don’t know thang
Flood the streets, that’s my whole thang
Walking out the bank with a thizz face
You didn’t think I'd make shit, now you watching what the kid make
Me against you, wait what? that’s a mistake
Boy you looking hungry need a handout, have this plate
My whole life’s on display so I stay clean
And I find the shit I say through my daydreams
Ooh, need to make cream, keep the garden snake free
Regardless y’all gon hate me so I'ma keep it mainey, bitch
[Chorus]
You know I’m speakin’ from the art
Not throwing shit at the wall and hopin’
You know I’m bleedin’ from the start
I got ’em all pissed off and I’m in the open, hopeless
Still rackin’ mines like I stole shit
Still outta time like I won't quit
Still receiving texts from my old bitch
Still removing hexes from an old witchEmbed
