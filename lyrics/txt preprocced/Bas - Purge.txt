63 ContributorsPurge Lyrics[Intro: Sam Evans]
Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
'Cause you're out of view
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying, but I cannot save you

[Verse 1: Bas]
I can't
City to city, a young legend fulfillin' my dreams shattering ceilings
It got me feeling myself
Look how I'm fittin' the belt, they never give me a chance
I never give 'em a breath, keep a foot on they neck
I go deep to the depths, submerged in it
I'm getting the urge, nigga
I'm killin' these niggas off, call me the purge
I just been peelin' the feelings off
Layers of inner thoughts, you're playin' 'em in your car
But really you're in my head like yarmulke synagogues
Bassy been a problem, they probably never could solve
Like me at the bottom, they probably got better odds
Than knockin' the rings off of Saturn
Find it hard to settle, I want it all forever
The speech, it don't get me bothered and the streets, you ain't get involved in
Y'all sweet like some kindergarteners
I got heat and I'm feeling heartless, heartless
I been makin' all these songs just for you to hear
Get these niggas outta here like the Uber here
'Bout to switch another gig, kill another year
Gang, Dreamville run the game and we come for e'rything, man
If we ask, they abide, pain from the sacrifice
Had to leave my other half on the side
I just laugh when my stock on the rise
Stack all this cash, couldn't've overdraft if I tried
You might also like[Chorus: Bas & Sam Evans]
I need to reset myself (Without you)
I won't neglect myself (With-without you)
I had to test myself (Without you)
I think I'm at my best (With without you)
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (You)

[Verse 2: Bas]
I can't
These pups ain't war-ready
Gettin' lost in the city like Doc Gooden, Strawberry
When the block hot tell Cosby I got puddin' already
In the drop top, bitch hop in it already
Yellin' "Fuck the cops," middle fingers to the opps
Stop with it already, y'all efforts get nothin' but F's
Y’all crampin' my style but I got hot with it already
This for the phony and the sleep
Throwin' up the goat emoji, niggas lookin' like some sheep
Presidential Rollie on me, bitch, I'm rollin' like a sheik
You ain't know, you ain’t low, I can call you in my sleep
Took my girl to Japan to do some shopping and, man
I could show you new options
Do what you want when you poppin'
Made a few loans to my partners to put a hole in your top
Just to spend a week in Colombia fuckin' hoes, eating tapas
Damn, if we ain't home, they adopt us
[Interlude]
I live round here, I live round here
Look at the strength!

[Chorus: Bas]
I need to reset myself (Without you)
I won't neglect myself (Without you)
I had to test myself (Without you)
I think I'm at my best (Without you)
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (You)

[Outro: Sam Evans]
