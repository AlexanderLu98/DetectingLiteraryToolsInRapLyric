Shine the light into the darkest part of me
All around you, find the one thing they can't see
Though they say
They'll take your pain
Don't give it away

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm like Thelonious at the underground piano
Dressed in camo, the grenades, guns and ammo
Death to Sambo, send him a bouquet and a candle
I came to take back that other two-fifths of a man, so
From a silhouette standin' in the aperture
To a figurehead standin' in the path of a killer
Young gorilla just scramblin' for Africa
Crept and will accept nothing but a massacre
Premonition of intuition is a bitch
Got a message from the heavens, all it said is to resist
Keep it brief like an elevator pitch
Or delegate'll switch 'cause the spirit is a snitch
In America, the rich love to wear it on they wrist
They call the shots, they don't wear it on they lip
Jinglin' of the chains, I can still hear it on the ship
One hand loads the clip, feel the rubber on the grip
Me and my reflection sendin' one another on a trip
I'm under 21 and bent, now you know what punishment, listen
It ain't an easy odyssey for you to follow me
We do kinesiology with no apology
You might also like[Chorus: Kid Sister]
Shine the light into the darkest part of me
All around you, find the one thing they can't see
Though they say
They'll take your pain
Don't give it away

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, the deeper the breath, the louder the scream
I cower between the two monsters out of my dream
A Cadillac, a limousine, an anti-nigga machine
And if I wake up alive, I bet they won’t come clean
Umpteen times, the warning signs went unseen
To me, they done something, they tried to clip my wings
But not before I understood how any caged bird sings
The soul was something before we became earthlings
Freedom is better than heroin, morphine or methadone
They force-feed their fears into our flesh and bone
Inside of my confessional, I decompress alone
I'm more skeptical of following the metronome
I guess technically I'm on another echelon
It just gets to me the way they lay the pressure on
It ain't an easy odyssey for you to follow me
We do kinesiology with no apology

[Chorus: Kid Sister & Raekwon]
Shine the light into the darkest part of me (Right, right, right)
All around you, find the one thing they can't see (Start the wave, God)
Though they say (Talk your talk, nigga, let's go, nigga)
They'll take your pain (How that shit go?)
[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Boy grown, hands like Roy Jones
King Tut bracelet on, encrusted, flooded in stones, bro
Hardest and the sharpest, merge like three-bedroom apartments
Pick one room, they all boom, let me start this
My art retarded, kids, the arsonist and ostrich
The moon is the part, we been partners, shit
Say no other, we the Jungle Brothers out in Kenya
How we did in December loadin' them cartridges
The lines is like nines, P80s, mean babies
Word to mama, poor llamas, paper we seein' crazy
Louis Rich, he the drummer
Thoughts from the black boy, boy, mama call ya
See the numbers stay maxin' and relaxin'
Truck jewelry and 2020 seven Hummers, we saw
I seen your stunters gettin' busy on the bridge
Headed out fleein'
You're dope D'ing, stop wasting time, take some shine

[Chorus: Kid Sister]
Shine the light into the darkest part of me
All around you, find the one thing they can't see
Though they say
They'll take your pain
Don't give it away3Embed
