(Verse 2 – Siddy Mitzvah)
Where you at?
I been stеady
When is the blue light coming in thе night?
Where you at?
I been steady, when the blue light come down!
Yeah
You don’t feel high when I come down
Take it all too much for what I’m feeling
Am I too bad when I come back?
Don’t wanna feel bad when I run back
Too many things on my back
Oh I was bad
Oh I was bad
Back!
Yeah, how I feel eh
We never know where the life is really driving us
I just wanna feel
We never know where the life is really driving us
Life!
It is what it is how we feel
Woah!
Whenever we gonna drive it we feel
Feeling too much easy
Too easy
Feeling lotta easy
Is it easy?
Coz I’m drowning, I’m drowning
Everybody wanna feel high when they drownYou might also likeEmbed
