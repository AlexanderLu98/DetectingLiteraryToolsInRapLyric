9 ContributorsDeliverance Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could get a taste of my freedom, I would savor every tidbit
Pilot planes like I was Tuskegee
The flyest letterman, call me collegiate
That's why I get violent on these mics
Can turn a phrase like Ike and Tina
Stories bloodied and beaten so well, we're calling 'em red tales, how convenient, facts
The struggle I know left physical scars as lasting proof
Mommy and pops residual trauma pushed them to bottles, Absolut
Homie, that '90s era was rocky, had to be sly and outfox the coop
Everyone knows a rose can grow from cracks, but most don't blossom fruit
So my lyrical watts like miracle drops, BB, I'm Posdnuos
That's De La from the soul
I'm undersold and over hip-hop to boot
They worship green like God
Got bands to ear like radio's top ten grooves
My samples clear, I push gems like DeBeers
No conflict, just the truth
See, I'm the plug
I'm giving the people the power, try not to blow out the fuse
I'm so close to these lower and upper cases that I guess that it's best I recuse
Telling me I need to party and bullshit to win
Well then, homie, I guess I'ma lose
Ain't no biggie, I'm black obsidian
Rap's new Gideon, summon the troops
Roc
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm turning over a new leaf
Same life with a new lease
Game time, different frame mind
Hit the lab up like a two-piece
I ain't a fan of the fame, y'all keep the bread and the groupies
I just want a group of loyal fam, and if I win, bet the crew eats, my God
This a stress-free zone
This the best freedom
I just want a group of loyal fam, and if I win, bet the crew eats, my God
This a stress-free zone
This the best freedom
I'm just tryna elevate
Ya dig?

[Verse 2]
They wasn't feeling that space shit
Told 'em I was on another level
They said they only investing in fauna and flora like pussy and flower petals (No)
Pardon my tongue, but I grew up building with gods and sparring with horny devils
You rumble with dogs, you come up with fleas and pottymouths trying to blacken the kettle
I am not an island
Hold up the diaspora with my limbs
Fuck up the system with this atypical gab
Some Converse and nylons
I am the calm version of a storm brewing
I'm a monsoon in Thailand
And if my Black fist and my womb irks you
Here's the world's smallest violin
Check it
[Chorus]
I'm turning over a new leaf
Same life with a new lease
Game time, different frame mind
Hit the lab up like a two-piece
I ain't a fan of the fame, y'all keep the bread and the groupies
I just want a group of loyal fam, and if I win, bet the crew eats, my God
This a stress-free zone
This the best freedom
I just want a group of loyal fam, and if I win, bet the crew eats, my God
This a stress-free zone
This the best freedom
I'm just tryna elevate
Ya dig?Embed
