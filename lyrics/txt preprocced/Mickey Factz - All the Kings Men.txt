13 ContributorsAll the King’s Men Lyrics[Verse 1: Ransom]
Lord to the ghetto, king to the street corner
Police warmers, this is where life expectancy meets karma
Street sagas, told by a tortured sinner who preach horror
Speak martyr, demon whisperer, labelled a beast charmer
Pete Parker, swinging through broken cities that we fathered
Teach toddlers, flashy convicted felons who beat charges
Peach cobbler, food for your thought if you want your peace larger
We robbеrs, gun in my joggers, don't gotta reach farther
Thеse are the rules but they don’t apply to a weak blogger
Heat sparker, flamin' filet and spray till the beef darker
Sweet talkers, drug-dealing killers, known as concrete chalkers
Street authors, come get these vivid scriptures that we offer
We fought for justice and peace, instead we got deep torture
See sharper, aim at these targets like an elite archer
We carve ya, knife in my pistol, bombin' like P Harbour
Three barbers fade on the track and leavin’ the beat scarred up

[Interlude]
They say, the funeral is a celebration
So let this verse in the Bible verse serve as reverse birth
We all children of Earth and today we give you back to it
I say, amen

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
Avid reader, learnin' through pages I've kept in Trapper Keepers
Master thinkers, studyin' paintings hanging in galleria
Strapped Adidas Japanese sneakers, I'm flying past Korea
Stamp the Visa, turnin' down women who look like Catherine Zeta
Passive drinker, premium diva vodka and black tequila
Packed arenas, while you put niggas to sleep like anesthesia
Wack demeanor, ghost to the industry, it's the rap Tsushima
That's Katrina, floodin ’the net, somebody grab Serena
Back and forth, what’s all the racket for, I captured ether
Stripes earned like the fastest cheetah tryin' to catch a zebra
Alopecia, you missing here on the list of classic features
Cats is weaker, puttin’ out sleepers, couldn't out-wrap a pita
Factz the reaper, verses eternal, that's word to Angelina
At my leisure, I was a prince datin' a ballerina
Had an eager followin’, that procedure was actually deeper
Whiz kid, don't gotta ask Khalifa, this track's a heater
You might also like[Interlude]
There's something holy about a body being put in a hole
And it's not full of holes, God bless
These streets ain't make you its dinner
So maybe you died but you didn't get digested, amen

[Verse 3: J. Arrr]
Yeah, this more than a verse from scriptures, your verses filler
Hurts-to-hear, I toss all that Jazz out; I'm worse than Philip
Hearses fill up, funny how Slum niggas can birth a Village
Word to Dilla, when the Stakes Is High, I gotta turn the grill up
They tried to box me in; a nigga burnt the ceiling
Urned the victims, ashes everywhere, it's like I'm burnin' incense
Earning figures, but I'm frugal; y'all niggas work for pennies
Worthless spendin', I keep my ends tighter than Ertz in Philly
Words of wisdom, looking for validation can hurt your vision
Thirst decisions hit you head on, that's the worst collision
Search the triggers, you was probably rushin' like Herschel
When it's first in inches, I stick to Ramen, I like them urban dishes
Y'all worship niggas, pick ya roll, my shit like Nurk and Lillard
Cross me, I can leave you horizontal if we perpendicular
Mastered my Q's and P's like Percy Miller
I don't work with niggas 'cause real recognize and they weren't familiar

[Outro]
You get a halo and not a hashtag your ninth grade year
I didn't pull you in when we dap
You looked so frail, I'm afraid I was gonna hug you to death
Now I wish I could hold you to life, amenEmbed
