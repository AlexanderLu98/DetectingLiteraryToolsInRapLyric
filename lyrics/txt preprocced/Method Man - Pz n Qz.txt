10 ContributorsPz n Qz Lyrics[Intro: Rome Streetz]
Huh, a-yo

[Verse 1: Rome Streetz]
Fuck letters (Fuck), had a thousand pills in the mail box (Uh-huh)
Heaven to hell, eight poppy state in the jail stop (I've been there)
Put two grams, then half a brick on a scale top (What up?)
Went from empty pockets that was popped to havin’ a lot (I did)
Then I elevated, niggas minds still trapped in the box
Kick the door down, they had no patience to Jimmy The Lock
Had a metro card, now it's foreign car keys
Simon Leviev, I finesse your skis outta all her cheese (My enemies)
Ignorant indians always gon' outnumber the chiefs
How a lost nigga gonna lead? (How?)
Poppin’ percocet pills with fentanyl, they don't want weed
My homie doin' fed time, his custy OD
Free loot, give the rivals no time to regroup
Keep loot in the pocket of my low ski-suit (Cash)
Niggas be frontin', don't think everything that you see true (Nah)
Eve listened to the snake and made the bitch eat fruit
Better stay wise, live spelled backwards, is evil (Uh-huh)
I'm only here for the green paper with the Eagle (Ahh, yeah)
They follow me, study all my game to be iller
Nigga, I been a Trail Blazer like Damian Lillard
Better get focused, but you know this, the frame of the picture
I aim to be richer, keep the ting-ting with the switcher (Grr)
My first fanbase was the pill poppers and sniffers
Now this new shit that I got more loot ready for a nigga
You might also like[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got a Ghostface Killah train the Gio, Gorillaz on Nat Geo
Pushin' P at the PO, the only fare is the RICO
We know this here is primo, that snap necks, nonio
No keno, you can bet that I got necks, nosino (Uh-uh)
Now, follow the credo, gambinos, and pink flamingos
The casino, with some guidos who sippin' on casamigos
Qué rico me amigo, dem tranquilo like muy frio
Pardon my lingo, but OMG, ’’Ayy, ¡Dios mío!'’
My method lethal, a little bit um Paquito
Fittin' all inside Palico, I leave you finished beneath though, uh
The meal plan is a million bands, no key though
And freedom with no ''M’', should tell you nothin' for free though
That's wild boy, no Steve-O, magnetism, magneto (Uh)
A star lord, but people gon' tell you it's just my ego
Or, my black machismo (Or my black machismo), known for the speaker
That's the keynote, these rappers out here whinin', that's the Pino (That's the pino)

[Chorus: Rome Streetz]
If it makes sense, then dollars what it gotta be (Uh-huh)
Puttin' plenty paper in my pockets, it's the policy (Stack into my pocket)
Protect your neck, keep the TEC on me, it's technology (Grr, grr, grr)
No apology, it's just a pile of G's (Nigga)
If it makes sense, then dollars what it gotta be (Uh-huh)
Puttin' plenty paper in my pockets, it's the policy (Stack into my pocket)
Protect your neck, keep the TEC on me, it's technology (Grr, grr, grr)
No apology, it's just a pile of G's
[Outro]
Ayy, you say New York City...Embed
