7 ContributorsPeter Pan Lyrics[Hook: Versvs]
You wanna be me but you don't flow like that
I didn’t even really wanna gloat like that
Fuck it, just letting you know like that
Where you going? To the lab? You should go right back
Stay home, you will never kill a show like that
You wanna be me and improve, be the man?
Bitch you Peter Pan, you don't really grow like that

[Verse 1: Versvs]
Zippin' em up in a bodybag, that’s the mission
Not givin' a fuck, everybody has to pass, I'm vicious
I attack these bitches, like your dad, bitch listen
If you really wanna rap you better ask permission
All these rappers think because they're shooting gats they're different
Got the Iron Man, but you don't have my vision
Or the raps I'm spitting, or the cash I'm getting
I’ve been counting all day, like a mathematician
Yeah, ’cause I'm better than ever, the level I rap is incredible
I’m extra competitive, every letter; I shred it and the pen is my medicine
Step on the pedal, you're dead in a second, I said it, I meant it
So never forget it, go head to head, you'll regret it
Terror embedded and remember I'mma get a vendetta
I’m fed up, so wether you let me, or whatever I'll get up
My music is forever spreading, like a fucking epidemic
But I was feeling kinda low to be truthful
Then they told me getting high's the solution
So fuck it, I did it, I lit it, and decided to make a banger
With Hi-Rez in high resolution, so vibe to the movement, I'm the truth, bitch
Just killing the game while designing the blueprints
It's time to persue this, tired of these new kids
Shit, I'm just assuming your life's a illusion
Brainless fucking entities, like, what are you even thinking of?
I came so far along, I don't remember where the beginning was
Not one of you rappers talking about the cup you're drinking from
But fuck around and I'll really fill the shit with lithium
You wanna any problem? Gimme some
'Cause I'm ready to fight
It's just a different feeling when I get on the mic
You care about all the money and the bitches you like
I care about the hip-hop that was saving my life

You wanna be me but you don't flow like that
I didn't even really wanna gloat like that
Fuck it, just letting you know like that
Where you going? To the lab? You should go right back
Stay home, you will never kill a show like that
You wanna be me and improve, be the man?
Bitch you Peter Pan, you don't really grow like that

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
Y'all don't really know like that, y'all don't really grow like that
You've never been through the everyday struggle, going crazy, crazy on the road like that
I've been doing this for a decade, something's I've said straight
While all of the time always gettin' less paid
Really got a headache, flowin' here in L.A
If you like real rap music, then press play
I don't have time for these wannabe try-hard's
Hit 'em all, and I'm bold; diehard
Please do not bug me, I don't need you to love me
I relate more than Freddy, Jessy and Chucky
Doin' what I gotta, what I gotta, when I gotta, for the diamonds that you gottah, you really think you're hotta? Nah
Doin' what I gotta, what I gotta, when I gotta, for the diamonds that you gottah, you really think you're hotta? Nah
