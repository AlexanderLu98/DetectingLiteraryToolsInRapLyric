SYNOPSIS
DiCaprio 2 is the second studio album (following *The Never Story) from JID, which is a sequel to JID's *DiCaprio*, an album that didn't lack decent songwriting, but wasn't really comfortable to listen to due to it's sound.

DiCaprio 2, on the other hand, didn't lack any of these factors. With amazing production, decent songwriting (although some of the songs on the album didn't have it), and atmospheric sound of old-school hip-hop, R&B, and jazz mixed into one album.

The project talks about JID's come up on Westbrook, about the importance of not taking drugs on Off da Zoinkys, and other topics.

Although the project did have some problems: I personally think that the only features that weren't out of the place, were Joey Bada$$ and Ella Mai, and the conceptuality wasn't there. Many songs didn't have a specific topic, which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that I know JID didn't unlock his potential enough with this record. Yes, the sound of the songs is good and all of that, but the range of topics was little, there wasn't a lot of difficult rhyme-schemes or something like that. I'd say, this project really needed something else. And with all of that, I still don't think it is a bad project. Yes, it maybe lacked something, but some of the songs on here were amazing. I think JID was adapting to a new sound with this record due to The Never Story being slow-paced rap almost on all of the tracks, but we all know that JID can do better than that.
