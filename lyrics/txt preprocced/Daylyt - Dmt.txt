11 ContributorsDMT Lyrics[Verse 1]
When dimethyltryptamine intervenes, you'll forget some things
Five senses for being weighed no triple beam
To get trippy g, just a vacation trip to me
Remember me the riveting reaper isn't it interesting
Remigrates gimmicks all grimacing when we get in sync
I'm grinnin' I done seen more blood than a killer's kitchen sink
Feeble fickle niggas freak, total opposite to me
Hit the grass and then I freeze me and nature's chemistry
This is due dementia fool a dimension I disagree
Dismembering members who get discrete in disbelief
Just a distant memory meanwhile I'm distancing
Slithering, blowing reptilians into smithereens
Scaling my environment I have been feeling differently
If I died within your sleep what if it wasn't a dream
Shots fired don't need a cigarette just a nicotine
Shit ain't sweet I'm going twenty nigga forget sixteen
Inhale mother nature's herbs that's how Iso hit the scene
I know it may seem absurd that's how they hope niggas think
I'm unseen and known unheard thought I mention different things
These are rituals at work for your brain I'm giving seeds

[Hook]
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide

Nigga this chronic is explosive
God I crossed hemp road with a Higgs boson
Divide and conquer like particles til I get quotients
Dude can hurt y'all
Newton's first law, I'm in motion
I'll get you quick to leave and hypocrites in hypnosis
Ten doses snap my fingertips and they'll forget more shit
When engulf the lies the truth ain't
Difficult to find so who can't
Expose it this shit's cold get it, it's encoded
Continue to give you a feel that you feel til I quit flowing
My temple is more than what my mental is
Embody a lit lotus forget phone is
And meth is a big bogus there's twenty four big poses
That's proof that kids holding been smoking hand me a stick Moses
The accidents of an exorcist when I spit potions
The definition of definition I lift hopeless
Repetitiously rip roving, lies stitched in our skin clothing
Name brand you need a brain scan fool get focused
Been Poe shit like them end-quotes and then potives
Don't want the control system in your head then quit posting
Fuck the world and then grope it til that bitch soaking
And if the truth is too hard to swallow little bitch smoke it

[Hook]
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide
[Verse 3: Daylyt]
Oh God, quill chosen
Metal flowers, steel rose and feel golden
Touched down, we still snowed in
“Roll with the princess” they told him
Mario life really showed us, the reptile at the end
Wowzer we Bowser exploded
Now overall message and trousers reloaded
Clouded weather, sensory deprivation
Was trial and error, mentally preparation for how to set up
Matrix face it, buying every item one or the agent taste it
Rappers at a cypher then cyph will ask for the stake, embrace it
Oh my God
This happens to be the effects drug
All these Rappers keep rapping about the next plug
Similes, holy trinity enemy, here’s a check stub
Next scrub, and the doctor give check ups
Shoot first, this first shot’s wrecked us
We asked out like direct em
And plus they got it on record
They say God got His own record
But we follow Lady Gaga
Baby say goo goo gaga
Maybe Goo goo God huh
Do Google really know who God is maybe
Google God
Has anybody really googled God? (Really googled God?)
[Hook]
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide
Everything you've ever been told is a lie
Take a hit of this forget it then open your eye
You saw it coming homie don't be surprised
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide1Embed
