62 ContributorsThe Light Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Mic check of the gods, nigga
Mic check of the gods
Yeah

[Chorus]
The shinin' represents the light that's in the darkness
The diamond, y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timin', remarkable and in alignment
Anything is possible, I promise, yo

[Verse 1]
I admit it, I was gone for a lil' minute
It's like I lost my glow, yo, my inner light was dimmin'
Now I got my mojo back, Joe don't know how to act
I'm 'bout to blackout, I never back out
Unless we talk or bringin' gats out
And every show is packed out
We bringin' cats out from South Africa to Glasgow
I guess you could say I got this shit mapped out
Now world domination by determination
This is mumble rap extermination
This is Godly interpolation
This is that "Who your top five?" conversation
Type of rap that fuck a Grammy nomination
Type of rap that I'ma take 'em to my basement
Bring it back, 'cause when it come to leavin' mics ablazin'
I'm adjacent to that nigga Satan
That ain't with debatin', no more time for wastin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The shinin' represents the light that's in the darkness
The diamond, y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timin', remarkable and in alignment
Anything is possible, I promise

[Verse 2]
Unstoppable if it's divinely guided
I'm like Mahatma Gandhi meets Muhammad Ali
Trapped in a rapper's body
Another old soul, in every lifetime you find me
My angels who surround me
Niggas was frontin', now they all behind me
Funny story how I beat the odds so oddly
Funny how I dropped all these bombs so calmly
Funny how I never found that shit, it just found me
It just, yeah, yeah
The shinin' (You know what I'm sayin'?)

[Interlude]
Something's gonna happen in your life that is going to affect everybody's life for the good (For the good), for the good

[Chorus]
The shinin' represents the light that's in the darkness
The diamond, y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timin', remarkable and in alignment, yeah20Embed
