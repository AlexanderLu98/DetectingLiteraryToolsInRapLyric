3 ContributorsGrandview Lyrics[Verse]
Just an old country boy, wearing my Osh-Kosh boots
Walked by the trailer factory, every day on my way to school
Early on in life, the only thing I wanted to do
Was buy me a trailer and move it down to Grandview

Got out of high school, got on at Whirpool
Bought me a car, two guitars and everything
Me and Patty were falling in love before the summer was through
I started thinking about trailers and high lots in Grandview

It was a scorching summer night, we just left the dairy bar
We was sitting out on Ridgeland Road in the front seat of my car
I said "Patty, if you marry me babe, I'll take good care of you
I'll buy a brand new trailer and move it down to Grandview"

She said "Ah your wedding song, it sounds real nice
And I could sure get off on sleeping with you at night
But I tell ya what baby, you want me, here's what to do
I want a brick home like my mother's, ain't movin' down to Grandview"
That's what she told me

There's been a lot of years, a lot of debt, a lot of pain
Our youngest baby's movin' out when she gets married next spring
When the bash is over, I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I got my trailer picked out, gonna move it down to Grandview
You might also likeI got this 28 by 70 double-wide
We could slide it on in there, honey
We can chock those wheels real good
I want it settin' nice and level

Back it on in there boys
And don't get no mud on my front porch
Cause the son of a btch is brand spankin' new, baby

Stick it into Grandview
Stick it into Grandview
Slide it on in there, honey
Stick it into GrandviewEmbed
