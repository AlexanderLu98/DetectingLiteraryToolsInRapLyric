1 ContributorTake A Breath LyricsIntro: (KidShazam & KXNG Crooked)
Yeah KidShazam, this one hits different
Tell em King
Yo what's happening it's KXNG Crooked
I dedicate this to all the rappers out there
That's better than the rappers that's on right now
I know it's hard hold up
You know it's getting kinda hard to

Chorus: (Constantine)
Getting kinda hard to breathe without ya
Don't take my oxygen away
Just can't be without ya
One call and be right on my way
Really hard to breathe without ya
And right now I can't feel my face
Don't wanna be without you
I do this stuff to numb my pain

Verse 1: (KidShazam)
Yuh (ha)
Been constantly, making bangers
Anger hanging from my neck, an anchor
Pull me down the ground ain't what I'm after
Laughtеr in the pain as I write the chaptеr
This pen is sealing healing every pain in my mind
Write the letter, let em know that I ain't running outta rhymes
Take a breath, back in the studio burning down all the mics
I be rapping like the hedgehog don't be messing with spikes (yeah)
You don't gotta think about the violence in act (fact)
Don't be shaking guns cuz you saw it in a rap (crap)
Don't think all that matters is you getting in a WAP (cap)
I ain't pointing fingers but you falling in a trap (Yeah)
My life gonna take it back
Write my story and make a track
Love to the fam gonna stack the racks
Give back to the Gs who all had my back (Shazz)

Getting kinda hard to breathe without ya
Don't take my oxygen away
Just can't be without ya
One call and be right on my way
Really hard to breathe without ya
And right now I can't feel my face
Don't wanna be without you
I do this stuff to numb my pain (KXNG)

Verse 2: (KXNG Crooked)
I know you wanna make it to the tip top
But it's difficult to get it in hiphop
So you side hustle bag it in a zip lock
Cause you're too lyrical to go viral on tik tok
Under the radar every time your shit drop
Cuz they listening and the kids bopping and you like uh nah dog
Yall really think that shit's hot?
How many spitters the top 10 got pen drop?
Silence of the lamp there's too many sheep
While reaching for your dreams there's too many sleep
But you in the deep so you gotta keep going
Through the pain and the failure you gotta keep growing
Let me tell you what the shit is about
This rap biz is a math quiz figure it out
Bigger the problem you solve the bigger your house
Bigger the checks and six figure amounts hit your accounts
If music is your real occupation this ain't a rap homie
This is a consultation a business conversation about your operation
I see the spot you're chasing like rock nation
What if you never meet Jay?
You never meet Em?
What if you never meet Dre?
What if you never meet them?
You better be ready and never over-wait to take chances
Then your chances can never be slim
I want you to make it
Chorus: (Constantine)
Getting kinda hard to breathe without ya
Don't take my oxygen away
Just can't be without ya
One call and be right on my way
Really hard to breathe without ya
And right now I can't feel my face
Don't wanna be without you
I do this stuff to numb my pain

Verse 3: (KidShazam)
My pain is a target for all the fakers
Haters turn the music to something greater
Later turn to us, cuz the others played em
Come crawling back but I don't like traitors
I do what? Papers get all over the desk
The sessions begin, substitutes stress
My breath is taken, making me confess
That without the fam it normally gets

Chorus: (Constantine)
Getting kinda hard to breathe without ya
Don't take my oxygen away
Just can't be without ya
One call and be right on my way
Really hard to breathe without ya
And right now I can't feel my face
Don't wanna be without you
I do this stuff to numb my pain1Embed
