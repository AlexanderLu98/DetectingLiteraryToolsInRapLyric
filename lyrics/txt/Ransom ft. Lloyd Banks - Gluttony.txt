7 ContributorsGluttony Lyrics[Intro: Dante]
Praise God
Why would you doubt the Church?
I belong here in Hell
Your prayers are worthless here
What is that sound? More demons?

[Verse 1: Ransom]
Always been vicious, never hired shooters
Fire Rugers, violent bruisers
Known to start riots and then incite the looters
Make sly maneuvers when you slide in Ubers, high abusers
Life is easy when your top's down and you know you're dyin' ruthless
Apply the blueprint if you steal the streets, don't feel reliеf
I know, it's hard to get up for work when you sleep in silky sheets
It's 'bout time, thеre's always an opinion when niggas doubt mine
I shoot perfect from three, and they'll say you miss from the foul line
I get sick with these foul lines
The shotty erase ya thoughts and blow out minds
Your body get traced in chalk when it's outlined, huh
Whether you hate or love us, pray the judges take our brothers
Fools'll learn from mistakes, a genius learn from mistakes of others
Devastation, every phrase I utter shakes the gutter
Said to Satan, "Wait for supper
Whoever don't get a plate will suffer"
Hateful suckers, I am too cerebral for you foolish people
Too deceitful, a money tree can only leave roots of evil (Uh)

Time to kick down the door again, clear the city for slaughterin'
Awful town, nigga caught up in
Not on ya side, you ordered in
I done went overboard with sin
You playin' games, think 'fore you slip that quarter in
Ain't no pain like the family kickin' ya organs in
Palace to raise my daughters in
Watch ya step for the screws I'm missin'
Cruel conditions, few collisions
Spinnin' blocks for superstition
Jake popped out, the coupe went missin'
Veteran, these fuckin' babies need supervision
I don't know what's worse now, the bullets or fuel prescriptions
Wannabes wanna confuse tradition, new cool sleeves, baguette'd legend
A masterpiece is a one day errand, .223s and 187s
Blew through G's, that bread's a weapon
Snooze through beef, your bed's in Heaven
Rule with peace, they'll double cross you
Few loose teeth a better present
Accurate stories don't take convincin', liars can't back and forth me
Back in Causley, you ain't seen nothin'
Hood taught us that since shorties
Back up off me, Gucci in traffic
One of you bastards saw me, platinum 40
Twenty years later, lookin' for caskets, call me
[Outro: Dante]
Forgive me for all of my wicked sinsEmbed
