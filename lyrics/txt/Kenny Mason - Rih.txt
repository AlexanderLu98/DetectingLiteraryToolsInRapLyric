21 ContributorsRih Lyrics[Verse 1]
I show you the technique
I show you the TEC, freeze
I know the effects, my nigga that catch plays, want me to set screens
Sort of like tech geeks, I accept my homie that bet games havin' his best week
I'm tryna invest, I may not be as street as the next
But live on the next street, ho don't test
Stick with the red beam, Boba Fett
Stick with no Ed Reed on defense
That mean the safety off it, yes
Even with AC, got 'em sweatin'
Thinkin' we ain't eating gotta say, even for KD, that's a stretch
Makin' it seem like it's eight feet but this shit really ain't' deep
Niggas pressed, came from the same scenes
In the city that gave me Gucci, Thugger and Fresh
Made dreams of becomin' the best
Ain't seem like that far of a fetch

[Chorus]
A-li-en, I'm R-rated like my name Rih-unapologetic
It's a seat at the top of this shit
They saved me, bitch and I'm finna (sit)

(sit kenny!)

Eighteen-karat solid gold wrist
The way it freeze, you'd of thought it was It
Where the treats? I'm a slobbering pitt
With rabies, bitch, I'm not finna' sit
Zone 3, bitch, I'm not from the six
But shout out the six 'cause I'm in the six
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ain't scared of hell no mo'
Ain't scared of hell no mo'
We already here
Ain't scared of hell no mo'

[Verse 2]
I show you the technique
I show you the best speeds
I show you the specs, I show you that flesh bleed
I show you the wet streets
My only request is that you don't test me
If I show you the test key, you still wouldn't best me
Show respect, my horoscope said being
Broke is my pet peeve and so I prevent
My partna' pop a Perc' and pick off a person
I can spot em' lurkin', bitch I'm alert
This choppa crop a perfect picture in person
Fuck a copper, cop a pistol and murk him
Cobra Kai, I kick this shit 'til it hurt ya
Buy my bitch a pistol before a Birkin
Practice with the pencil, scribblin' verses
Tact and skill'll kill a nigga for certain
I was workin' on it when I was workin'
Used to tell me I was better off workin'
Now they tell me I look better in person
Now they tell me I look better than perfect
[Chorus]
R-rated like my name Rih-unapologetic
It's a seat at the top of this shit
They saved me, bitch and I'm finna (sit)

(sit kenny!)

Eighteen-karat solid gold wrist
The way it freeze, you'd of thought it was It
Where the treats? I'm a slobberin' pitt
With rabies, bitch, I'm not finna' sit
Zone 3, bitch, I'm not from the six
But shout out the six 'cause I'm in the six

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't scared of hell no mo'
Ain't scared of hell no mo'
We already here
Ain't scared of hell no mo'3Embed
