25 ContributorsBrag Swag Lyrics[Intro: Elzhi]
Yeah, yeah, this your boy Elzhi
Finally here now
It's been a minute though
You know what I'm sayin? I came up from nothin
Doing my thing, so I got the right to brag swag
Making money off music I create
{"Create"}

[Verse 1]
Yo, the day that Hell snowed is when El fold, poetry's well told
It's entertaining, keep niggas training like the railroad
Stingman, what I bring in is dope as the kingpin
Slinging, OG's threw me beneath the wingspan
Expert, through the less dirt, but still my TEC squirt
Bucked, then it gets tucked in, just like a dress shirt
Been a beast in a winter fleece, now for your dinner feast
With the pen unleashed, if there's a priest with inner peace
Quick to lead, stick chicks of the thicker breed
Get fricasseed with trigger speed, you puffing nigga weed
I buy $100 bags, Cadillacs, Impalas, Jags
Yeah, I show you how to brag, while the hours drag
Spit quotes that slit throats, bet it could split boats
Get votes off shit road, I'm the legit G.O.A.T
No statistic, to bitch niggas I'm chauvinistic
I tote a biscuit, carry arms like shoulder discs
You might also like[Chorus] (*scratching*)
{"You heard what I said"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
{"Nigga you heard what I said"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
{"Makin money, money"}
{"For the, for the, music that a nigga create"}

[Verse 2]
Remain a fresh goon 'til my flesh prune, you'll need a vest soon
To catch a chest wound, now you rest above the crest moon
On your block, get your door knocked, then by my warlocks
Who wore Glocks and left you with stains too deep for Clorox
Run rap beneath sun cap, levels is untapped
Done laps around a spun mat, hoes get their buns slapped
Y'all panic for all static, that's what I call frantic
Looking shook as a small planet becoming volcanic
Off top y'all soft pop, weak as a cough drop
I love cop to stop in the mall so I can club shop
Veteran, you better involve us all in the lettering
If I don't get your girl wetter than, I must have met her twin
Create rhymes that are straight bombs and call 'em Napalm
I date dimes and maybe an eight if she got great palms
'Nough said, get at a rough dread so I could puff red
I cuff bread, I'm paid and got maids that could fluff beds
I even snuff heads
[Chorus] (*scratching*)
{"Hey yo"}
{"Hey yo"}
{"Yo, yo"}
{"Nigga you heard what I said"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
{"Nigga you heard what I said"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
{"Making money for the music that a nigga create"}
