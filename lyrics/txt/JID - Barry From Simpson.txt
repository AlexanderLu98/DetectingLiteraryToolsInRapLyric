58 ContributorsBarry From Simpson Lyrics[Intro: JID, DJ Drama, and Young Nudy]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Yeah, hmm (Oh and of course I got to shout my nigga, Barry)
I mean Quay, goddamn, Columbia, that nigga, goddamn, so Eastside
Boy he better, goddamn, come to the studio and check his pockets (Yessir)
Bringin' thirty rockets, Eastside niggas don't play, haha (SinceThe80s, I fuck with it), uhh

[Verse 1: JID & DJ Drama]
Either you do or don't do it
If you put me to it, I'ma get it done (Gangsta Grillz)
From a city that don't see the sun
Either you a sinner or a citizen
Niggas ain't runnin', they gettin' guns or a chopper that's little as Big Sean
He on the block with that Barry Bonds
I was with Barry from Simpson (Shit)
Stockin' bonds, talkin' funds
Clockin' money, the game a jungle
We playin' Jumanji, I'm in Jamaica
JID playin' rugby, stand in my Vans
Stan Van Gundy, stand on my plan
Plant on my stands, man of my word, word up my man
Heard I got work, work what you serve, oh verse by versе
My verb like perc, I slow it down, my vеrse like syrup
I like the sound, gun rounds on mother Earth
With a little pump, you get smoked like Purrp
Get a nigga jumped, don't fuck up my shirt
Nigga J.I.D stand for "Jumped In Dirt"
When the Wesson squirt, it does wonderworks
'Till you with the monsters in the underearth

Umm, bitch
You know Zone 6, nigga, you know we do shit like that you know
We get money, you know what I mean, that shit go through the money counter
It green, come out blue
Oh you niggas don't want us to bring DiCaprio back
Stay true to yourself, nigga, real ones only, pussy
Bitch (Bitch)
It's not what you want
Shit

[Verse 2: JID & DJ Drama]
Either you do or don't do it
God put me to it, didn't help me through it
Homie had to work around the hood
But if heaven's waitin', what the hell we doing?
Back on Glenwood, lookin' for juugs
Black owned businesses distributin' goods
Put crack on blacks and then shackle a foot
They go back to back the way back to back (J-I-D)
And we was back in the woods, runnin' from white niggas
Night killers, tri-pillage, my village, trifling, idealist, identity crisis
I dig it, I get it, I've been in fights that I didn't win and I didn't die
But they didn't live, so we did it right
Better not get in if you're not gonna slide
'Cause you not gon' fit, just stay inside
Don't play no fence, no switch no sides
Go grab a switch, JID Jackson Five
Joe's whipping kids, Mike's still alive
Pour up some Prince, pro nigga rights
Hold up your fists, throw up your sign
Throw up your clique, throw down and fight
I fucked up my fit, but you ain't gon' hit 'cause I ain't no bitch
[Interlude: Young Nudy, JID & 2 Chainz]
Umm, bitch
Fuck you know 'bout they Glock with that switch on it, nigga? Hahaha
I like that right there, yessir
You know we got them bitches in the spot 'round the trap (Yeah)
Roll inside, don't swipe (Bitch), bitch goin' brazy in the bitch, ya heard me (Tony, bitch)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm on the green, like I'm in the golf
I sold back, so this pillow talk
I made a juug off a dinner fork
I ain't goin' back and forth, dental floss (Woo)
When this denim on, it's dinner time (Yeah)
I eat a rapper like the sixty-nine (Pussy)
I done flipped the pack, I done flip some racks
One thing I ain't did was flip some fries (Nah)
Everything big, gon' minimize (Big)
Eeny-miney-moe is how I pick a ride
Either us or them, you need to pick a side (Tell 'em)
When she come through, she like "This a vibe"
My neighborhood, it got gentrified
Yard filled with Black Lives Matter signs
My trigger finger need calamine
What do the heartless do for Valentine's? (Boom)
Valet park, and I skipped the line (Bump it)
Can't win if you quit tryin' (Yeah)
Been had the baddest bitch, that'll Trick your Daddy like Slip-n-Slide (Woo)
On the mission, my opponent missin'
Wraith came with the solar system (True)
Strip club, pole position
Gettin' money, so consistent
[Outro: Young Nudy, 2 Chainz & DJ Drama]
Guns imported (Bitch, bitch), ya heard me?
You havin' money, you livin' fly, you feel me?
Get high as much as you want to (Bitch, bitch)
Ain't gotta stress about it, nothin' to stress on your B roll, nigga
You know what I mean?
