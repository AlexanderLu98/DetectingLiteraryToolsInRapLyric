1 ContributorTake You Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just a hired gun
Takin' shots at moving targets for fun
Gettin' your fix from hunting down the young
Goin' around and aiming one by one
ODB praying on the innocent
Just a method man
Burnin' ‘em holes right through the back of my head
Playin' with fire begging for oxygen
Did you hear a word I said, did you listen

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ghostface killa)
Trying to cop a feel
(Psycho thriller)
Don't know what is real
(You get off on the fight or the flight crawling into the night)
Like a fucking disaster
Devil knows you're just a blood sucking monster

[Chorus]
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
Dig you into the ground
(I'mma take you down)
(Down)
(Down)
(Down)

Who's in the shackles now
Coming around trying to sway the crowd
Telling your lies to overthrow my crown
You're just a dеad man walking through the town
Looking to manipulate but you're tiеd to your ball and chain
I got a gravel pit with your fucking name on it
If you want something to remember me by
I got a silver tongue that cuts like a knife

[Pre-Chorus]
(Smoke and mirrors)
Lying through your teeth
(Face the fire)
Honey I ain't sweet
(You get off on the fight or the flight crawling into the night)
Like a fucking disaster
Devil knows that

[Chorus]
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
Dig you into the ground
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
I'mma take you down
Dig you into the ground
(I'mma take you down)
(Down)
(Down)
(Down)Embed
