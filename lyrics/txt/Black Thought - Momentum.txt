Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Russ]
Don’t compare me to employees who hopin' they see a check
I’m in a drop top McLaren just hopin' I see an ex
She hopin' we reconnect, no chance
I’m tryna be bigger than the Beatles, not hold hands
Keep on throwing stones, I'ma make statues
No face tats, but people got my face tattooed
Freeing the damned by being free as I am
And speaking belief into people sittin' with reason to stand
Who just might be needing a hand, I got you
9th Wonder blessed, provided the gospеl
I feel God-like, my fans all feel like apostles
Modеl your mind after mine and you gon' be just fine
Model your mind off these other guys and you gon' die
That’s why I’m always at the head of the table, follow my lead
I'm a money tree, women tryna swallow my seed
You wasn’t with me at my roots, though
I’ve been on a quest for love for women with a Roots fro
And potential like a JUCO
Athlete, catch me in the backseat with ass cheeks on my lap
We in Utah, so we fuck to a jazz beat
It’s actually therapeutic, she classy, I’m Ferris Bueller
Swimming out in Turks and Caicos, beware of the barracudas
I got heart, I’m the cause, my life is just the effect
I’m altering my reality, living in VFX
Made a half million dollars, then fell asleep on a jet
Fuck the club up, Atlanta ain’t seen this since BMF
Told my accountant, "Reinvest," gotta pound of weed for stress
I might drop two platinum albums in a year like DMX
Keep on living in my light and let my faith just lead the way
'Cause if I’m taking y'alls advice, I’m probably making y’alls mistakes
Instead, I’m out in Egypt, just baskin in the results
Of listening to myself and mappin' out all my goals, uh
My career is a course in self-confidence
And how ownership leads to opulence, adjust your oculus
If you tryna rise to prominence
Bust down the doors, assert dominance when you call your first conference
I’m honest with my women, that’s probably why they all hate me
They focused on bein' Lori, I’m focused on bein' Jay-Z
The run that I’m on is gonna be longer than the Euphrates
Gotta super model chick that’s badder than Tom Brady’s
Rap game bunch of clowns in disguise like John Gacy
You got one plaque, and it’s not even your song, I got eighty
Lately, y’all are lazy, waitin' to be carried
Lotta y’all are dead, you just waitin to be buried
Listen, I’ve been hot since Michelle and Barack
You out your mind if you think I’m gon' stop, ha
You might also like[Chorus: Russ]
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'

[Verse 2: Benny The Butcher]
Conversation alone in the mirror (Uh-huh)
I told myself before the year up (Before this year over)
I'd be another homeowner and another millionaire, uh (Facts)
My life crazy, but I'm way too busy to tear up (Too busy)
Just please keep them broke vibes from near us (Walk away from me)
We different, I'm not the one to converse (Uh-huh)
By the time you mumble your verse
I'll be in top five company, comfortably, gunnin' for first (First)
If it's rap or either trap, one gon' come with some perks
The other comin' with a six foot hole dug in the earth (Damn)
Look, I know how them numbers lookin', I don't gotta check stats (I don't do that)
The pussy good, but I'll still never text back (Nah)
Being unsigned ain't never changed my potential
With every wave of a pencil, a nigga gaining momentum
Wanna walk in my shoes, but I'm not trading my Christians
For Crocs (Never) but lil' rap niggas only cravin' attention
It's funny when you hot (Funny, uh), but it's ugly when you not
Everybody doubt, then suddenly you pop (Pop)
Niggas sign them 360s, and hope it do something for their stock
But I turned on more money than I got, and that's a lot
Had patience and it helped, I remember thinkin', "Make it big"
Then decorate the crib with paintings of myself
'Cause that who I owe (That's who)
You gotta give yourself credit, they definitely won't (They won't give you shit)
You won't hear this flow so often, so treasure these quotes
As far as cheddar, we know enough plugs with bricks
That I'd probably never be broke
I'm used to not gettin' sleep, that's a twenty-four hour business
Exercisin' my brain like 24 Hour Fitness
Haters look at my jewels, get the feel of resentment
Feelin' like I'm 'posed to buy they friendship (What?)
I remember sellin' merch dolo, mailin' my own shipment (Dolo)
Now I'm on, y'all hoes thinks it's Christmas
Am I the one trippin'? (Me?) even if you think you this nice
It's gon' be hard, try to match my ambition
I'm goin' on a rampage, handguns and champagne
House need a damn maid, my watch need a lampshade
Body language everything, read what my hands say (Read what my hands say)
I'll go a little slower if you need me to translate (Need me to translate)
Boss moves, keep options, that's how you plan safe
Just sealed the deal for a hundred with a handshake
Weighin' out the racks, a hustler who really made it out with rap
With the jewels in the bank accounts to match
The Butcher
[Chorus: Russ]
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, when I first started recording, I swore it was more important
To make it to Soul Train in a gold chain and some Jordans
Than makin' my own lane and then blaze in the trail forward
But I came from the old days where the vision was too distorted
To come to an understanding, a partnership and plannin'
For your marketin' and brandin', though the office was abandoned
Am I surprised? I'm monetized like more Morgan Stanley
I'm in a position now to make a difference for the family
My wife, kids, and in-laws deserve Renoirs
Picassos and Warhols distressing my memoirs
About the knowledge of experiences I've endured
Create the bars, full of information like SIM cards
I left court rooms as a defendant, fully acquitted
In spite of the bloodsuckers who try sully my image
And fightin' with motherfuckers who tried to tell me I'm finished
As if I'd ever consider the sky above as a limit
When I am the scientific, my honor, I'm dying with 'em
Iconic, gifted, it's rare and requires a fairly different
Kind of spirit, far as inner feelings, I ain't tryna hear it
Bein' fearless how I'm pioneered into a higher tier
If I am peerless, I guess I am here 'cause ain't nobody near me
On a pyramid and I'm adhering to the game theory
I maintain, momentum and I made a name clearly
But I can't stop, I believe it's no rest for the wary
From the cards I was dealt, to awards on my shelf
I turned scars to a sense of regard for myself
Based on where I set the bar, I made it hard for myself
I lent the hand before my brothers called for my help
When I was still an inspiring, gun right for the firing
Tryna find a part-time job site that was hirin'
Never concerned with the age or the height requirements
Tryna shake the ways of the hood, like the violence
Watchin' the homies being forced into early retirement
I'm stuck as another product of their environment
I was told that achievement of goal starts to tryin' at
The prize, keep your eye on the hard work, rely on it
And nothing else, don't just hustle for your health
Fear they gon' do nothing for you until you secure your wealth
Focus on the top, I've been hot since before crack rock
You out your mind if you think I'ma stop, yo
[Chorus: Russ]
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'
I didn't come this far to only come this far
I gotta, keep momentum swingin', keep momentum swingin'Embed
