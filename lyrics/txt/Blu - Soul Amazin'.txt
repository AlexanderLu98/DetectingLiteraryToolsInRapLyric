2 ContributorsNatural Highs Lyrics[Intro: ShayJToday]
Splack pack
Them daaaamn dogs
95 South
69 Boyz
Jam pony
That's the shit i grew up on
That real down south shit
Just thought it be right, to take it back, check it out

[Chorus 1: Big Nics]
Layin' low, chillin' with the bros
You know how it goes
Flippin flows, call over some hoes
Tell em' bring some mo'
Layin' low, chillin' with the bros
You know how it goes
Flippin' flows, call over some hoes
Tell em' bring some mo'

[Verse 1: ShayJToday]
Life's a bitch don't eat her out from da back
Might as well get all you can out of that
Would shout my city out but I'm barely home
Cell phone on roam, when you be on that road
Call up my dawgs and then
Call up some brauds
I bet you expecting me to rhyme with manage'
Shall I continue?
Sharp as a ginzu now I'm off to the venue to find things to get into
With da click vibin
Them drinks in hand
Dominoes on that night stand
Bowls and dutches blunt guts and slushies
E&J  in my right hand
I got a cup filled with that liquid
Pass the blunt I won't hit it
Still livin' life off a natural high
But Best believe I still get lifted
Cause In-tel-lec-tu-al conversations
They seem amazing
When you hella faded
Entertaining when they smokin' the In occasion
Mind of a rich man, lungs of a Jamaican
My inhibition totally risen
Judgment with No pun intended
Pretty nigga lookin' for a coefficient
I can take to the room and
Make a deep incision cause
You might also like[Chorus 2: Big Nics]
Niggas talk about ballin'
Car engine still stallin'
Asked my homie what da lick read
He said shit dawg I can't call it
We just modulatin some ganga blazin'
Contemplatin'
Soul amazin'
Nat-u-ral highs
Keep me passin' the times
And I'm just livin' my life
Livin' my life
Say I'm just livin' my life
Livin' my life

[Verse 2: ShayJToday]
Back on the scene
Crispy and kreme (cream)
Bitches wanna intervene when they see us on the scene
Chillin with my team
Tryin to gain green
Stay away from the fake I'm allergic to gangreen they call me
The top notch nigga
Hopscotch nigga over every other rapper that u said hot nigga
Say it ain't so nigga why not nigga
Gotta lay low so I can't blow the spot nigga
So Wu-Tang wit it
Wu-Tang wit it
Snapback no fitted now we all finna get it
Just another day
Same mouth different titty
Ridin 95 south and I almost got a ticket
Cause da music real loud and I'm speeding past the limit
You don't want problems when twelve get up in it
I just wanna chill with a couple bad bitches
And do hoodrat shit with my friends, GET IGNANT'
Please just let me meditate
I just wanna reach a better state
Let my mind move so free through the air just like a featherweight
I'm tryin to call Mayweather plays can't hit the strip club with financial aid
Chi city said get money get paid
But a young nigga tryna get laid, ayyyeeee
[Chorus 2: Big Nics]
Niggas talk about ballin'
Car engine still stallin'
Asked my homie what da lick read
He said shit dawg I can't call it
We just modulatin some ganga blazin'
Contemplatin'
Soul amazin'
Nat-u-ral highs
Keep me passin' the times
And I'm just livin' my life
Livin' my life
Say I'm just livin' my life
Livin' my life

[Chorus 1: Big Nics]
Layin' low, chillin' with the bros
You know how it goes
Flippin flows, call over some hoes
Tell em' bring some mo'
Layin' low, chillin' with the bros
You know how it goes
Flippin' flows, call over some hoes
Tell em' bring some mo'Embed
