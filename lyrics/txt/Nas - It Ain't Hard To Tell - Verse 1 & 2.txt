1 ContributorThe Bad Guy (Say Goodnite) LyricsHook
Say goodnite to the bad guy Tony Montana
187 murder, ain't a movie, cut the fuckin cameras
Killing rappers in my sleep, don't get blood on my pajamas
Pulling hammers clip banana sink hope you find Atlantis

Verse 1
My goonies in dem trenches, and pulling irons relentless
Call my hitta my apprentice, he's ducking a murder sentence
I'm bout my 2nd amendment for vengeance outcome horrendous
This tool got good attendance, you icy run me ya pendants
Neckless got neck hurting, wet my tec just be squatting
Alert emergency service, no surgeon got no insurance
Fuck yo bitch with endurance, her pussy like ocean currents
I'm currently her preference, she come just like a recurrence
Bitch you know that i'm nasty, pussy nigga get at me
Try and clap me I'll just highjack ya Acura like a Paki
Distracting with this gat in my khakis nigga no lacking
Cock strap you evacuate, school you hacks I graduate
Money bitches just gravitate, to a nigga have to make
Cause a nigga is passionate, fuck the world watch it masterbate
Taking you all to hell, triple 6 ya prison cell
Got Macs you got a Dell, ask Nas it ain't hard to tell nigga

Verse 2
Go hard just call it white, beef and kill you tonight, you ain't bout that life
Smoke you cause you in my pipe, me angry you wouldn't like, shift like capital type
Piece of cake I take a bite, and yo bitch cause she was ripe, she want me to wife
Bread i just need every slice, cut her dat pussy was tight, I'm sharp as a scythe
Bitches trippin candy flippin, molly water syrup sippin
Burnout like a transmission, pay me dats my superstition
Need parmesan my palms is itchin, commas on my mind I'm sprinting
Like olympics top in my division, good addition
Money like to multiply, subtracting haters cause I'm fly
Hope you die, trust nobody ask my nigga Shy
Know all my gwallas gonna ride, down for a homicide
Take your life for a bribe, you chicken bout to deep fry
Gimmie hot sauce, straight boss, bitches pay me mind like it cost
She sitting on my dick chris-cross
Mad money pissed off, shine cause I mint floss
Stay on trees like moss, Imma get lost
