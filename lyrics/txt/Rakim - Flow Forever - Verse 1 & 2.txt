Another word for synonym
Primitive minds take caution cuz the implement of intricate words is imminent
There’s a reason why Eminem is eminent, never will be an equivalent
But synonyms aren’t equivalent
Ignorant, I got my own instruments, I just listen to Infinite and Curtain Call
My written rhythms make the incertitude certainful
Not tryna confuse ya, I’m flirting with terms
So spread the word like kids spreading germs
Not undeveloped, your girls egg is wedding my sperm
Together forever, unless you split your leg clean
Keep it PG-13, we be killing her dreams before she even set foot on this earth
My verses will have you reversing the tape
Butthurting with rage, now you nursing the pain
They say no pain no gain
But the only thing you gained is more pain in the rear end
You think I’m near the end but as I approach the plot’ll twist
I hope you got the gist, you need to see the proctologist
My thoughts are evolving with the help of a god assist
Solving the issue only creates more problems
Society is full of irony the problem of my genre causes hella anxiety
Only category my genre will be in is variety
I know I always bay homage to my birthplace
But the place where I had my first birthday is notorious for earthquakes
So when I babble about sucking at scrabble but being good at wordplay
I’m not being a TJ I’m just making the earth shake
Making simple things complex like these kids on their first shave
I could straight up tell you what I’m saying in my songs like
“Hello, my name is Jacob, I like rapping, girls, and basketball”
But after all
That’s no fun when I can spit it in intricate patterns with rhyme schemes and flow
And anyways, that’s really the only way I know
If you really want a short description of who I am just read my twitter bio

Ever since I heard Eminem rap has been my religion
Now I been writing so many raps I read in a rhythm
Jotting down words in a room that’s lantern lit
Ever since I heard “Not Afraid” I took it and ran with it
They say I be committing hella sins
When all I’m doing is putting nutella on everything
They calling me nutella chin, saying I’m unintelligent
But even if I’m a dimwit
My mastermind jots down lines well past my bedtime in a room that’s dimlit
Put me on the map to stay and I’ll mash the stage
Cuz if you spark the fire, the fire will rage
And I’ll fill up the page with beautiful pain
Lyrically superior than half of these rappers and I’m half their age
No rappers in my heritage, here it is
Not a product of Rakim
I’m a product of Eminem, Nas, and Rakim
Pac, Bob, Immortal tech N9ne, K.Dot, and Hopsin
They help me to craft my work but it’s not rob art (Robert Kraft)
I’m just an arrant (Aaron) patriot with my shotgun loaded, (Aaron Hernandez)
The top spot like Odin is what I’m gunning at (Odin Lloyd)
They just got my back when the weight of my backpack threatens to shatter the fact
That me and Q are still school boys sitting writing rhymes in the back of class (Schoolboy Q)
So I got references and fathers when my cunning slacks
I’m Peter’s son like Adrian, but I’m not running back (Adrian Peterson - RB)
I’m working on my mind craft (minecraft)
So when I got writers block I know where to place block
I listen to Pac, so I don’t trust anyone even tho I got hundreds of friends on Facebook
I just take pieces from the masters and craft them into masterpieces
And together we making the rap family tapestry
These days, they saying less is more lyrically
But 9 is not 10 figurative or literally, now real rap is overrated
No more wordsmiths just Will Smith skillsets, the high top has faded
When I write words like this I know I can make it
When I step in the booth I’m gonna spit the truth, not brag about getting your girl naked
But I sure can do that if you want, you know the word, just say it
Or find another word like it
