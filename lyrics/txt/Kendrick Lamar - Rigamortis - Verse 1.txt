1 ContributorMPR LyricsL ..A..M..I (Cruise)
(Chorus)

Im just Tryna spread The truth , i dont got No regrets
Observe Whats Around You, Where is Your Intellect ?
I pray That I see the days, where We All Getting Bread
Manipulate The masses playing games with their heads
Lotta people getting quap found missing or dead
It Is what it is, That can't fuck with my head
I pray that I see the days where We all Getting bread
Nigga Asalam Aliekum , Money Power Respect

(Verse 1 )
Sit Back While They manipulate the fuckin masses
Subtract the Good , Miss Out On Your sunday Masses
So far from Hood, My Goonies Still understand It
Money Got me Frantic, Less Friends ,Less romantic
Dreams Of owning corporations & more vacations
Lifes A blessing every second, New Creations
The way some niggas living life is heaven sent
Like Fuck the majority Im tryna be the 10 percent
Before you ready to earn be willing to learn
Gotta meet the right people, dont wait on turn
You know the affluent 5 milly's up im talkin
They got people 5 billy's up im Talkin , And they Can Care Less, How Loud Your Dogs Be Barkin
They dont need to shoot, there aquitance still gon spark you
You dont realize you brainwashed to spend your last
God made Everyone perfect ? So why go Buy A ass?
God Made everyone perfect ? My niggas bustin Macs
God Made Everyone Perfect ? They dont believe in That
They Like Lami Illuminati, Damn chill With That
Illuminati was made to distract your ass
And social Media was made to distract your ass
Develop ADD while Programmers ,counting racks
Pop That bottle ,thats Snapple fact ..And that's the end of that
( But all I Gotta say Is )
You might also like(Chorus)
Im just Tryna spread The truth , i dont got No regrets
Observe Whats Around You, Where is Your Intellect ?
I pray That I see the days, where We All Getting Bread
Manipulate The masses playing games with their heads
Lotta people getting quap found missing or dead
It Is what it is, That can't fuck with my head
I pray that I see the days where We all Getting bread

(Verse2 )
I know my father ,But dont really know my father, Does that still Make me a bastard ?
Gambiling with  a pastor, ever since we split up heart colder than North alaska
Im just trying to go  Aplly for this FAFSA
Long lived exhibition,Exhibition for recognition nah, exhibition for definition
I was raised to beleive that adults are always right they never listen
Until I act sick & jump over the counter, No prescription
Ironically ,Most of them Work  a hopeless living
Advice Given ,Needs New Revisions & New editions
Never Being Mean ,just brutally honest
Id be in  a Ivy Legue school still speaking ebonics
A Wise ass would say practice what you preach
But the Key To My Success Is that I cherish what I seek
Ain't even 20 but with whoever I meet, Know the Dog a beast
Hold Me to  a higher pedigree,Then Your average rapper
What im spitten isnt real, then im  a mighty good actor
You always on the run ,Uh Pocket book snatcher
Said where the truth well ima bring it right at ya
Because the good got to rise i am not talking about raptures
No biblical reference , Guess Im Illuminati For that Previous Sentence
Feel My team Is the best im so ethnocentric
Killing it, Rigamortis Song By Kendrick Lamar My nigga
Spit Kareem Abdul ,Ja-bars My nigga
Lami We gon Make You  a star my nigga
Ready know i heard of that, but most these niggas in the game
So fuckin wack ..
(Chorus)
Im just Tryna spread The truth , i dont got No regrets
Observe Whats Around You, Where is Your Intellect ?
I pray That I see the days, where We All Getting Bread
Manipulate The masses playing games with their heads
Lotta people getting quap found missing or dead
It Is what it is, That can't fuck with my head
I pray that I see the days where We all Getting bread
