3 ContributorsNew Generation (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: PXWER]
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker

[Verse 1: iNTeLL]
I stay on it, I be goin off, big brain know-it-all
Never follow protocol, a poet flowing motor oil
Show me how to show 'em all
You don’t gotta panic or get frantic
I'm as cool as the band on the Titanic
If you don't understand it, you should pan across the planet in a hammock
Get your mind off that New York City transit
Now in Spanish, mira, gente, yo me gusta la calma
Y tranquilo for my people and don’t forget about karma, uh
See, I'ma do something that they only say they do (Do what?)
Steal your game, call you over to play a game with you (The fuck?)
I never lied, but you bet I'm guessing my aim is true
Boy, it's Baby Blue like no oxygen when I flame the booth
Sideburns, Wolverine, but I got my Sabretooth
In the grayish coupe, I got more than one like a Wayans spoof
Finally shot a gun, such power I got to aim and shoot
Gotta show respect like when older heads share the game with you (Knowledge)

[Chorus: PXWER]
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker

It's P, I be the beast when trees roll
Niggas peep the wagon, catch shells through peepholes
I keep hoes on knees and foes on ten toes
My speech flow further than Niles go
And my best shoes run on tracks, that's my miles, bro
My eyes low, mind's fried from getting too high, yo
Told 'em I got the hook, wrote the verse, so fuck it, I’m back spazzin’
Bargasm, when I dip in the pocket, you know what happened
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker
Hey, y'all can’t fuck with Fifth
Like R. Kelly, can't fuck with the kid
A drunk nanny, nigga lost his wig, I'm playin'

[Interlude: PXWER & Method Man]
I know what it’s like to lose
You feel so desperately that you're right
I ask you, to what end?
Dread it? Run from it?
Destiny arrives all the same (Yeah)
And now it's here (Yeah, yeah)
Or should I say (Yeah)
I am (Look)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
No Walter White, but I'm breaking bad
Mazeltov, breaking glass
Make a path, I make 'em roadkill on one tank of gas
Take a drag in TGI Friday with a Jason mask
Problem is y'all don't see the problem, let me take a stab at it
Slash at it, bunch of fiends and rap addicts
I'm just tryna break to leave and you can't even break a habit
This ain't rap, this is black magic, back on that package
Two straps on 'em like backpackers, now back to rappers
You backstabbers, right back at ya
And backtracking so cliché
But nothing's more cliché than black rapper
What's the fact of what comes after laughter?
Y'all wasn't factoring the fact we ain't laughing with ya, we laughin' at ya
Mef your master, silverback, overachiever
My chef black and he whip crack like overseer
I blow the cheeba, my index finger can blow the heater
And the track mixed with that cocaina, I blow the speaker (Yeah)
[Chorus: PXWER]
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your maker
Pen to the paper, nobody safe, yeah
Like death on your shoulder, come meet your makerEmbed
