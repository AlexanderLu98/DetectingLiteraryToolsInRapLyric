1 ContributorMobb Romp LyricsVerse 1: 16 bars
Spitting the hard raps ya hitting the tarmac
In the car behind bars we’re beyond that
Of course we will score with the ball on the floor
Like a door being stalled by the door mat (what’s that)
Fanging it like it’s temple run
Banging hits our fast till my pencil cums
Freewrite mine or I’ll stencil some
Still fight with the ink till their ain’t non son
Switching my flows as Mary J grows
Let my soul glow like Kurtis Blow
The mic I’m holding it tight just creeping at night
Like a thief with a knife that’s right
I’m breathing and might be leaving advice
To these mcs not treating me like
I’m the king in their life so I’m sneezing these rhymes
A beast till I die so stop telling me lies
The drop came with a boom shaking the room
Not a shame to consume all these boos real soon
You hear my platoon from the womb to the tomb
If you mean to assume that im zooming to doom
Like fu#k that sounds absurd
My suburbs the best place on earth
My face ain't been straight since i was birthed
Rapping my ass off till the day i burn
You might also likeHook: 2x 4 bars
Mobbing on a mob romp creeping on a come up
People think i'm cold but im boiling like a blood clot
Make music old but not selling at the pop spot
Like black moon assume I know that i got props

Verse 2: 16 bars
Living in a crazy town
Run shit like sportacus in lazytown
Puns hit according to what im laying down
And like bonnie tyler you'll turn around, yeah
That's the sound of a beast, on clowns i will feast
Surrounding police out of my mouth i will speak
With a pound full of Gz, we’re as loud as can be
Hunting around on the grounds for the weak
Keep things rapped like Hip Hop (yeah)
There called thongs not flip flops (yeah)
Don't rap about my wrist watch (yeah)
Cos Hip Hop I got it locked(yeah)
Dont play when im rhyming, do what I say like im simon
For days i been climbing, like a sunray I been shining
Curfew I broke it in two while breaking into
What you do too

Bridge: 8 bars
The old school im painting a picture
Just two turntables and a mixer
Cutting it quicker dissed by the sisters
Facing the struggle had to uplift her
Grandmaster Flash and he's bringing the message
Any other problems Mellie Mell tell em
Back in the days when hip hop was 7
Peace love and unity were representing
Verse 3: 16 bars
Gold in the beamer C3P0
John cena you don’t see me tho
Naughty by Nature you feel me flow
Clocking doe at the show like fat joe cos you know that I’m dope
Pretty pretending paradise filling
Freaky for frisky pitch perfect printing
Silly for CDs see me selling
Shout it out one more time then start yelling
Frank Nitty in the city bout to cash a check
Gain respect represent then the last to jett
No regrets gets sketched like an architect
From the hearts of men, we’ll depart again
The man well dressed a lord like finesse
The best from the rest in a tribe like quest
Dj jazzy Jeff with the rhyme fest on the m I c
Pork mc spitting viscously

Hook: 2x 4 bars
Mobbing on a mob romp creeping on a come up
People think i'm cold but im boiling like a blood clot
Make music old but not selling at the pop spot
Like black moon assume I know that I got props

Verse 4: 16 bars
We’re all on our job like corn a cob
We’ll call it a mob unlocking the locks
From the pop to the lock strictly hip hop
Miss me tiptoe to the tip top with a quick stop
Get the best MC to contest with me
To see if they can r-h-y-m-e
So I’m pleased to be in the s-y-d
And proudly I’ll e-m-c-e-e
Talent is gold that’s 24 carrots
To spark in the dark I ate 24 carrots
Put down my phone for snakes and ladders
You rappers sound like 24 dying parrots
Get to know the name I’m going insane
P-o-r-k gaining the fame
Bringing the pain make you jump like Kris kross
Not snoop Dogg but drop it like it’s hotEmbed
