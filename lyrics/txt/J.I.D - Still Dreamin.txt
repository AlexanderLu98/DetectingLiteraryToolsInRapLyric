Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: JID]
If you ever want for anything to work, you gotta try
You gotta live like you dying in a minute, take your time
Use it wise, dream higher than "The Ribbon in the sky"
Don't gotta take my advice, you know, who the fuck am I? (Yeah, who the fuck are you?)
But just a little fly, finding smells through a shitty walk of life
Or Walter Payton on the sideline, the pie line is mine
In my mind, I try to see myself through God eyes
Fuck a guideline or tour guide, nobody helped me, but I’m not fine
God got me, but if not, then this nine got me
Nah, Akhi, this bird shit, you pop cocky
I gotta get the mop, they tryna leave the boy sloppy
Slip once then it's my fault, second time, then you got me fucked up
Tried ending it and knock me off my rocker, tough luck
Kick my ass, let me run it back, that was tough love I was raised on
Bad kid hittin' chained dogs with the acorns, East Atlanta playboy

[Chorus: JID & Ari Lennox]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It’s about to be five, I gotta grab Syx at seven o'clock
Hopped on a plane, then in a drop
I stick a car seat inside of a car that it ain't supposed to be in
Young, black king ducking the hoes in my DM's
I was cruising down Moreland couple years ago
I was broke, but I knew blood, sweat, and tears, you know?
I thought I knew it all but I didn't know a thing
Ain't scared of the cold, bitch, I got ice in my veins
I looked up to God, she look up to me, smile, thumbs up, right on
How I'm supposed to slide when my check engine light on?
Bought a whole crib long way from Double Trees
Nickname her Chanel and I love her double C's
JID told me, "Get ’em," I said, "It’s gon' be a breeze"
Talk slick shit ’cause I got VV's in my teeth
I took us from EBT to Amex (Right spot)
From dreams of BET to the Grammys (Yeah)

[Chorus: JID & Ari Lennox]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lute & Ari Lennox]
You hold me down like four flats
Let me drive the 'Lac to get some food, couldn't pay you back
Though I offer gas money every time, you say take it back
Heard word around town that you been askin’ 'bout me
But that's surprisin' 'cause last time we spoke
You told me life was better off without me
Damn, that's deep, cut me deep
I let the pain seep 'cause that makes for good music
It don't hurt to check to see how you doin'
You watch my stories, so you know how I'm doin'
Don't be no ghost, watching all my posts but don't like a picture
Swear, I miss you but it's yo' fault that a nigga ain't with you
See, we had plans, sell my two-seater for a sedan
Call your daddy just to ask for your hand
But you was playin' (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: JID & Ari Lennox]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
