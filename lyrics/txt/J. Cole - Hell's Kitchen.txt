Cole World (Cole world, Cole world)
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got platinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause Heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day
You might also like[Chorus: J. Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Tell my story, I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
One day, hey

[Verse 2: Bas]
Yeah, omission's usually, an admission of guilt
Hari-kari yourself, all the way to the hilt
You get nothin', no love, zip, zero and zilch
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth
There's a Judas in every crew, concealing a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fuck's sake, you niggas emanate effeminate traits
Bitch nigga, we could never relate
Nah, cause man, you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school or somethin'?
You eaten that bird food or somethin?
You sick with that bird flu or somethin'?
That's my word, cause every where I turn
When folks I known for years that couldn't pronounce my name
And asking me for pics, there's something 'bout this game
It's somethin' for the bitches
It's somethin' for the bitches
[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause Heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day

[Chorus: J. Cole]
But for now I'm cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Tell my story, I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
One day, hey31Embed
