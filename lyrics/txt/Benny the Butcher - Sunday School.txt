34 ContributorsSunday School Lyrics[Intro: Benny the Butcher]
Mic, mic motherfuckin' check in this bitch
Mic check, one, two
Ah, let's go, yeah, uh huh
Ayo, Daringer, turn me up some
Niggas gotta feel this
I gotta hear myself
Yo, look, ayy, look

[Verse 1: Benny the Butcher]
Niggas ain't see what I saw, a brick turn into a pot full of gold
Over that, spent my daughter first birthday locked in the hole
Plot full of holes, came back stronger, I'm in control
Soft white from my block to the stove, not in a cone (Nah)
Me and West like Stockton, Malone, Gotti, Capone
Niggas dressed like they copyin' hoes, papi, come on
Stop it, you know you not with the smoke, I get you loafed (Brrr)
In 'bout a year, how niggas gon' deny me the throne? (Huh)
Rappers y'all compare me to, niggas scared of me too (Niggas shook)
It make they heart beat faster just hearin' the truth (Have your heart beat, nigga)
I stick my .40 out the window while I'm steerin' the coupe (Uh huh)
We pull up to your front door if I'm hearin' to shoot (Let's go)
They say we sold dope and did random actions of violence
Our neighbors in the 'burbs wanna hand us back to the projects
They say I'm on tour while the Family package the product (Uh uh)
Everybody gon' eat and I'm standin' next to that promise
Can't believe y'all when y'all talk about the guns y'all shot (Can't believe that shit)
And all the money runnin' to 'em and it's crumbs y'all got
Just let me know, come check with me when y'all want y'all shot
It's ten shooters in my hood for every one y'all got
Ayy, look, I had to dumb it down for niggas, you gotta do that (Sometimes)
It's like bringin' down the prices, you gotta move that
I was in the Feds with braids under the durag
I'ma volunteer to do ya if it come to that (Uh)
I fuck with smart bitches, in the club, I caught bitches starin' (Yeah)
All these jewels got these hoes' train of thought slippin', ah
Brought a quarter thing back, that's a small mission
In the dark kitchen, all you hear is the fork clickin' (Woo)
In the zone, lookin' through the holes of them yard fences
I'm dope, yeah, you know the flow from them park benches (Uh)
Three things happen when you keep your torch, nigga
Put in work, you might sell it, or you gon' get caught with it, ah
You might also like[Chorus: Benny the Butcher]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick (Whole brick)
Fiends still hit me when they dope sick (Brr, who this?)
Cook with gas for the raw, so much glass on the floor
I got my bitch kitchen lookin' like I broke in (Broke in)
Let's go, quarter thing, half a thing, whole thing (Whole thing)
Daydreamin', thinkin' 'bout cocaine (What you think?)
When the plug throw me action, I let my man quarterback it
Looked up and all that stackin' got us both paid (Both paid)
Real niggas know (Ah, ah, let's go)
Only my real niggas know (Uh, yeah, yeah)
We ain't comfortable as y'all, nah
I been in way too many bang outs and brushes with the law
My real niggas know (Ah)
Only my real niggas know, yeah
We cook with gas for the raw, so much glass on the floor
I got my bitch kitchen lookin' like I broke in (Haha, ah)

[Verse 2: 38 Spesh]
Huh, yo, my bricks better than theirs, y'all better come pay dues
A extra gram jumpin' back for every one they lose
These niggas borrowin' the guns they use, not me
I got my own stick like I'm 'bout to come play pool
Ride in the car with bricks, that's one brave move
I never did it, that's why my bitch one paid mule
Niggas say they want gunplay, cool
But they don't really wan' go there, it's like Sunday school
Them niggas dead on arrival, don't question the title
No chance for survival, they ain't checkin' your vitals
A fast car with a gun, tryna catch up to rivals
I got a Lamb' and a stick like I'm fresh out the Bible, huh
A young nigga with Mexican idols
I just left from Ohio, we just met up for Cinco de Mayo
Complexion for connection, I mail an albino
I went broke and sold wax like I'm sellin' a vinyl, huh
Nigga, I know your type, you not thorough
You can't come around unless you got a referral
You made a couple bucks, then you shot for your girl
Bought a bullshit watch, now you on top of the world, huh
Got a squad of all geniuses
I been in charge, but findin' a plug just gave me more leadership
No scales for the weed and bricks
They wholesale, the only time we see scales when we cleanin' fish
Trust
[Chorus: Benny the Butcher]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick (Whole brick)
Fiends still hit me when they dope sick (Brr, who this?)
Cook with gas for the raw, so much glass on the floor
I got my bitch kitchen lookin' like I broke in (Broke in)
Let's go, quarter thing, half a thing, whole thing (Whole thing)
Daydreamin', thinkin' 'bout cocaine (What you think?)
When the plug throw me action, I let my man quarterback it
Looked up and all that stackin' got us both paid (Both paid)
Real niggas know (Ah, ah, let's go)
Only my real niggas know (Uh, yeah, yeah)
We ain't comfortable as y'all, nah
I been in way too many bang outs and brushes with the law
My real niggas know (Ah)
Only my real niggas know, yeah
We cook with gas for the raw, so much glass on the floor
I got my bitch kitchen lookin' like I broke in (Haha, ah)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Hahaaa
Yo, it's a shame what we did to the highway
Even worse if we made it there safe when we pulled in the driveway (Yeah)
Three and a half whole ones gone by Friday (Gone)
Now we ridin' back, smokin', listen to Sade (Haha)
The dope's up in Maryland, the coke is in SC (Yeah)
We get it off the dock, the plug come on a jet ski (Poppin')
I hit my man up, see what's the ticket for ten (What's up?)
We right back Sunday night so we can flip it again (Y'all ready?)
The whole town goin' crazy, a few slept on it (Woo)
Still potent though, I only did a two-step on it (Uh huh)
You ain't gotta be a genius or be deeply educated (Uh uh)
Keep the money and the drugs completely separated (That's it)
We ain't doin' no dumb shit, nigga, we all smart
Same sweatsuit on, underclothes from Walmart
Nah, I ain't actin' crazy with them dudes (Haha)
Got the diesel with the stamp that say "Lady, sing the blues" (Ooh)
Got the coke comin' in like they seizin' on the news (Face)
If I'm winnin', what I look like gettin' even with you fools? (Huh)
It's an occupation (Yep), if a nigga get jammed
Hit his lawyer and his fam, then we move the operation (Ow)
What?1Embed
