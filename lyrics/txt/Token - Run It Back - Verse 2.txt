1 ContributorWhat You Need LyricsVerse 1:

From the Go, so I had to get goin'/
Been known that for me to win is in stone/
Got december hot like winter went wrong/
Don't panick or go frantic, it's no pic-nic/
Less sun, more fri-gid/
Been gettin ol' money from my mindin my own bidnizz/
Tried to tell 'em, me going off is pro-to-col/
They don't be knowin' tho, that I'm a know-it-all/
Born-to-ball, M-V-P at the U-C, showin' offff/
God damn, now that's a bad man, mad bands like an advance on the advance/
Putttin' in work, half machine, half man/
Start a riot if I'm onnnn stage/
Still smash like a crash, at a crossss way/
In it deep, cuz I be where them shaarkss stay/
But with that bitin' shit i don't baaaar take/
I'm so selfish, I keep an L lit for dem dark days/

Verse 2:

Y'all could run it back cuz I ain't done/
I done made it out a place where ya cain't come/
Odds of me seein' 21 not-fair/
Up to no good, whole hood got the cops-scared/
Like a verse from 3 stacks, I need that, Mike hype, everything I drops-rare/
Out the hood dishin crack, lefts the pots-there/
Now they lookin' for he bass like a dope fiend/
Give 'em a single, they ask for the whole thing/
Raw and uncut lines, like my coke clean/
They said, "Dam, chill dawg you needa cool out/
Was the type to go broke and take a tool out/
Played my cards right, it was fool house/
I tried'a move by the code but I was too loud/
With the newfound, smooth sound, move round/
Know that I know i'm the best thing ya never knew about/
Would say that I'm 2nd best, but I'm too proud/
I ain't gassed up, I just got the juice now/
See my dream in front of me I pursue em/
Newest one out and the best to never do it, nothin' to it/

Verse 3:

Lowkey in the streets I'm like a narc/
Say I'm goin' off, tell em what I do to charts/
Know I stole the show hope they don't pursue a charge/
A lot of rap is trash but I what I do is art/
Ion' just play the part, born-star made to start/
Makin' hits, pullin strings, ugh, like I play the harp/
Bright as fuck, made of stars, or I'm razor sharp/
Cuz I was thankin' and thought, maybe to raise the bar/
Defiant and quiet, but quite outspoken/
I love hearin silence from the haters, to me that shit sounds golden/
Couldn't see the biggest without focus, hard to stay level with a life how the Dow Jones is/
New rap sucks idk whachall smokin'/
When I step on beats I leave the ground broken/
All that glitter ain't gold, like a brown token/
And if ya don't knowwwww, ya now knowin'/Embed
