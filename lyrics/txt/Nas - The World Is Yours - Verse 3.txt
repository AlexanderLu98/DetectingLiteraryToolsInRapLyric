1 ContributorSin in my DNA LyricsPre-Chorus

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way X3
Get in yo....

Verse 1
World listen
I’m bout to take this human’s body with an instant
I’m about to kill his soul and rip him up and twist him
I’m about to take his brightest light and make it glisten
Look don’t even ask my name no need in risking
Another casualty
I don’t believe in just forgiving

Cuz I’m his number one blemish I’m his Achilles Heel
They went to war in the heavens and now we all hear
So don’t be thinking that it’s God versus me
Man the time is coming soon
For now it’s you it’s versus we
If I’m coming down to hell
Then I bet you coming down with me
Cuz I’m the best terrorist you call me Kamikaze

Bridge
In every global calamity
In every ghetto community
In every shooting every act of crime
In every tragedy
You might also likeIn every single murder in the streets
Everyday
I’m at the epicenter I got evil in my DNA

Chorus
And I got sin in my DNA X4


Verse 2

*Heavy breathing*
I doubt that I’ll ever get far
I hear his voice coming and God
If you help me get my body and soul back you can have it all

Cuz I’m needing back
My demons act up
I’ve tried to live on the fence now I’m stuck
I love what I hate and hate what I love
My brain is dead weight when temptation comes

When I contemplate bout my decisions
Before I know I desire womans
I need deliverance more than a vision
Cuz Malcolm got territory I’ve none
Cuz my
Alter ego’s
Full of evil
And I’m not him
Father forgive me again because I might sin
I know the reason you died is not so I can
Use the blood in vain but lately all that I’ve been
Is indifferent but I’m ignorant and I bet you know
All that I see from me is uh my lack of self control

And when I....


Shh It’s cool It’s cool
I just take over your flows
I just take over your mind
I just take over your soul
It’s like I’m venom you Spider-Man and I needed a host
Some people try to define me and this the way that it goes
They say that..

2nd bridge
That I am the manifestation of sin
That I am the war that's waging within
That I am the evil that’s in the air
Made of the most deadliest seven sins plus despair
But I am the reason of your demise
And I am you when you listen to lies
And I am the Devil that’s in disguise
Cuz The earth is my turf
I am sin solidified
And I got sin in My DNA

Verse 3
Nas said the world is yours
Yea I know
We gon meet when you mature
That’s fo’sho
Cuz I been present since the dawn of time
Way before the hours mine
I been waiting for your grandparents to go outta line
I been taken forbidden fruits
Make 'em naked with hidden truths
And once they took a taste outta knowledge I showed the biggest proof

I showed the earth that I’m king and I am god
I even tricked the world
The devil is facade

To all the kids with potential
Just like Yodes
I’m bout to take
Control of your mind your heart your strength
Yes my goal is take one’s soul and making it my home
And bring extra junk to make it my own

Oh I don’t sound like me
That’s cuz silenced Yodes
Imma convince you not to take the narrow road
Alright go back to God lets see what I be on
I’ll bring a spirit or two prolly seven fold

Cuz I paralyzed people
Know that I’m evil
Yea you know my name

I’m the reason why doubt the son of God who was slain
I’m the fact too many leaders in the church are ashamed
Cuz you can clear ya history but your past will stay the same

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way [What you gon' do]

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way [What you gon' do]

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way [What you gon' do]

Get in yo lane Ma nigga
Stay out the way X4Embed
