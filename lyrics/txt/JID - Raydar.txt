[Intro: The Last Poets]
Radar, sonar, laser beams
Jets, tanks, submarines
Megathons, H-bombs, napalm, ga—

[Verse 1]
I got the shit you would light with a lighter
Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the 'K and the Colt
I know some rappers that—how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I know some niggas from down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours

[Chorus]
It rains, it pours
(Ooh, we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty yard line)
(Personal foul, unsportsman-like conduct, number six on the defense, fifty-) It rains, it pours
It rains, it pours

They got the shit they could pull out
I know it could blow out a back, yeah
They got the cure to the vax'
Facts, you know where it's at
They put the money, the crack in a sack
They got the axis, they got the Atlas, they got the maps
I got a real, real, real bad bitch
I just told her to come to the back (Oh man)
They got the people in office
Them crackers that had us in chains
They make the laws, they goin' hard
Dang, they even started a gang
How you gon' win in a losable game?
Make a change, man, niggas say the same thing
Every day, complain and the sun shine
And the cloud rain, but won't lift a finger
In the danger, niggas been endangered
Been indentured, now my niggas got business ventures
With my .9, I'm like ten Avengers
Snap a finger, I could end adventures
Rapper? Singer? No, killer, nigga
You a cop or you a nigga killer, woah

[Outro]
It rains, it pours
It rains, it pours (Ooh, we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty-yard line)
(Personal foul, unsportsman-like conduct)
It rains, it pours
(Number 6 on the defense)
It rains, it pours
[Part II]

[Intro]
Man, they won't understand, man (Oh, shit)
And, man, they won't understand, man (Fucked up)
And, man, they won't understand (Uh)
I live in harmony and peace
And the sun will once again rise up in the East (See)

[Verse]
Somebody told me when I was small
That the pride cometh right before the fall
God son died for us all
So for mine, I'm running through a wall
Lost a battle, it's still a war
I'ma steal the cattle, then burn the farm
We could travel but the journey long
I prefer we get a lil' murder on
Drop the top on your convertible
How we feelin' should concern you
We been speakin' but ain't never been heard
So now we screamin' at you word-for-word
Everything a nigga learned gotta burn
My lil' nigga in a hearse, I was hurt
Fuck a rap and fuck a verse, I could blur it
Tryna see how many urns I could earn
Are you entertained or are you concerned?
I'd be afraid, I'd be in church
I'd say a pray, I pray I say, I say I shade
They play like God, no play-by-play
We take our charge, we take our place
It'll take our hearts, it'll take our faith
But we need the majority to make shit shake
I'ma get me a quarter, I'ma get in a car
And I'ma get on a call and go state-by-state
And I'm picking the target then I'm picking them off
You better be Beyoncé if you say my name
Orange ambient sunlight and daylight savings
Might save a nigga's life
It ain't never too bright to broad day a nigga
Night time vampires and they'll slay a nigga
It's not like landslide so you can take their slide
I'm a canine straight in the pack lookin' for Jiddy, he's takin' it back
Crackin' a whip, whippin' the crack
Just like them crackers that did to the blacks
Just like they thought I was finished attacking
A beast awoken, I peel at the crackin'
They inferior and fear when I'm rappin'
But I ain't rappin, this is spiritual
Shed a tear so it'll curate when miracles happen, huh
Mirror, mirror, why the fuck is you laughing?
Dear, dear, let me volunteer 'cause I'm not in fear
I'ma jump in the ashes (Ooh)
Oh shit, "It's getting weird"
Nah, shit is weird, what the hell is heaven on this hemisphere?
If them bitches sell it, I'ma end it here
If we come together we can send a message
But I know they never gonna land it here
So I got the method, one, do you better
Do you want better?
Bitch, you won't do it, let's bet I will
Collect my stones, ho, collect my gems
Protect my stronghold, respect my shield
Until I'm long gone but while I'm here
I can snap my fingers, they'll disappear (Boom)
[Outro]
La-la-la-la
