1 ContributorStill G Lyrics[intro]
Who the fuck came with no promo, and no money and didn't make a hit
Who came in all solo no co-sign and didn't make a vid
Who made like 6 Tabes no kim k but I'm raising kids
Sonned these rappers like the godfather of the rap game like god damn
[Verse 1]
Since I was young I've been making moves, no choreography but we movin smooth
Since 07 now I'm 22, at 13 I was killing too
Same thing in high school, but on stage I was being booed
Last year I did a tour, they all paid just to see me wooh
Life changed and i stayed the same, honest and never made a claim
Unless I'm on it I changed the wave, now you see Mini-Gofrans everywhere
Hold up this that new flow, Hold up this that God flow
You can copy but you'll never be me hoe, you iggy azalea I'm Riri hoe
This that pick up, fuck up on the first Verse , now I'm getting sicker on the first verse
Now I got you triggered on the first Verse
I'll end your career on the first Verse
I'm gasing up like a Rolls Royce, no auto-tune I don't change voice
Like MCQs with the same choice, I'm all G here making noise
Damn it fuck it look how i made it now, over 10 years and I'm still around
Last year we made 20 grands, i gave it to whoever held me down
Finally started giving back man, I finally made my old man proud
I got my mama a new ring too, made her happy that's all I wanted to do
[Verse 2]
Oh man now I'm the best, like I sneezed on the beat and I got blessed
They playing with fire when I get dissed, Fuck around and get killed with gofran shits
Fuck a league we ain't even in the same sport, I'm way outta reach they need more, More luck so they can come close
But they'll never do it's case closed
People around me know what I'm about, if I don't trust you we can't hang around
Trust issues yeah I've been back stabbed, but I'm still standing how about that
I got friends that turned into enemies, I'm not gonna lie it's killing me
But it took a long time rebuildin me, so fuck you if you think you destroyin me
Thank god that I'm still alive, thank god that I fought back
No quit in my genes that's my hashtag
Whenever I hit the bottom I bounce back
I was supposed to take a break but fuck that, making music man yeah i love that
Thank you god you blessed that, and I'll be damned if I ever forget thatYou might also likeEmbed
