OK's debut single "Who Stole My Last Piece of Chicken," was dope, but it didn't really give you a good idea of what this group is about, lyrically speaking.

     Buy this album, take it home, and prepare to sweat brain cells trying to keep up with the way these kids rhyme. MC's Prince Poetry and Pharoah Monch flip the illest off-beat rhyme style to come out since Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith. Here's a quick taste of the Pharoah's scientific, hieroglyphic lyrics from "Prisoners of War": "Wake up to the mathematics of an erratic rap rejuvenator of rhymes that sort of come automatic." Organized is definitely on some other shit.

     The cut that seems to epitomize their concept most is "Releasing Hypnotical Gases." The title should suffice to let you know how bugged it is. The beats fall right in synch with the lyrical atmosphere, full of mad soulful jazz breaks topped with crazy sounds like the backwards guitars on the title cut and the sound of bubbling fluid before "...Hypnotical Gases." "Roosevelt Franklin" makes a statement about life in the 'hood. Roosevelt is a brother seeking a balance between doing well in school, being a good son to his moms, while getting paid slinging rocks on the down-low. Other stand-out cuts are "Fudge Pudge," "Audience Pleasers," with a laid-back freestyle feel, and the ."..Chicken" remix hooked up with some fat live instruments. Organized is taking hip-hop to new levels. Those who like to hear progressive and innovative styles need to get with it.Embed
