1 ContributorWe Are the Chosen LyricsLong before creation
We were known by Him
He saw a righteous nation
That He would dwell within
He gave a promise
He made a plan
Before time began

We are the chosen
Citizens elect
Destined to connect
We are the chosen
Grafted to the Son
We are the chosen of the Holy One

We arе not divided
We are not alonе
For in our souls united
We stand before God's throne
We are the promise
We are the plan
Brought forth by His hand

We are the chosen
Citizens elect
Destined to connect
We are the chosen
Grafted to the Son
We are the chosen of the Holy One

We are the chosen
We are the chosen
We are the chosen
We are the chosen of the Holy One

We are the chosen
We are the chosen
We are the chosen
We are the chosen of the Holy One...Embed
