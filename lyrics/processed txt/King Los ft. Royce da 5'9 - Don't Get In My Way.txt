I used to be defined by having the biggest nine
Being followed by a stripper chilling with a fifth of Bombay
Now I'm just a stand up nigga looking down, dealing with the digits and the pounds, don't get in my way
Hollow head, bullets got a forehead on it looking big as Sade
On my way to visit yet another project chick, she living building 5A
I be there everyday, with another chick
They be singing to each other "You're all I need to get by."
Mary J's, John Blaze on some other shit
Niggas wearing plaid shirts around their waist instead of weapons so this tec's playing checkers with them for the thug of it
On your mark (mark), nigga where your heart?
Couldn't knock a glass of water off the table with a running start
My hypothesis is I'm cut from a different cloth
God stop, make it with a rhinoceros
Y'all ballers, nigga I'm extinct, heater by the sink, y'all in hot water
I'm a Molotov thrower, y'all the cop callers
When it pops off it's shots falling all the smoke clears after shit happened

Been flexing since big body legends
Fronting like you getting it but your clique probably stressing
My whip got 'em guessing, my clip got the answer
If a prick got a question then your bitch probably pressing
I cop, fly drops and new sneakers
I've been top notch since high tops and 2 beepers
You ain't on my frequency, I frequent the Waldorf
Freak with the drawers off, in my jeep with the doors off
I ain't chopping the top or murkin' the tire
Coppin' coutour on tour, you know, merch and attire
Know some OG's, OT that murk the supplier
Chop the whole bird up bumpin Earth, Wind, and Fire
Slow down, show you how to earn that shit
Whip the wheel count and money while you turn that shit
I told a bitch, "Look, you get one turn, that's it. Just don't get no
Lipstick on this Hermes shit."
I'm from the murder, where bitch niggas murk if you crispy
Either you pushing work or you working with the 50
But my circle never shifting, I copped my bitches red Birkin' bags
And got 'em jumping out of purple 760's
Got a house in the hills but I'm as hood as it get
I feel as good as I look and I look as a good as a bitch
I got a stack of hundreds, that say none of you niggas rapping want it
You fucking Photoshop bitches that look wack in public
Passes? I'm my hood? Nigga hell no
Benz on the arm, you can call that an elbow
Get it? I said Benz on the arm
Meaning what you push depends on the strength of your arm
And at the same time, your elbow bends on your arm
But I'm really in a Bent, with the arm
And I've got it bullet proof, so really I've got the whole bent armed
Same color as baking soda with the old bent arm
Old bent arm, back over the stove
Whip it up one time for my nigga Marty Jones
In the feds, but he used to keep the V's all chrome
It's still block shit, my niggas C's came home
Probably dig the money up and cop a fucking phantom
We don't know you from the streets, you mother fuckers looking random
Talking much, you finna get a nigga yee ain't never had it
Stay the fuck up out my way that's automatic, god dammit
When the sky turns night...
