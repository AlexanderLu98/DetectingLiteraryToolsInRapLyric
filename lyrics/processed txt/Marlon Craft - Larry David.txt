The Larry David of rap
The Sammy Davis of tap dancin on rap fans
Who sent backhanded appraisals and try to label the facts
You can't explain to me jack
Shut the fuck up
I was a baby when it came to the trap
But I can tell by your eyes you cradle a rat fore you cradle a gat
Screamin you don’t give a F and I believe you
If we talkin fable vs facts you ain't able to chat
You won't be havin you behavin for a favor from some rich old dudes who gave you a stack then gave you a slap
I ain’t beggin for a space on the map
I'm trailblazing until Dame and them back
4th quarter tall order like the coach yellin at Dikembe to get back, shit
I'm the type to play well in that scenario
That's a mary goat they say when I rap
Ain't gotta say the name you could tell by their face and reaction, Craft
Old dudes like “He takin me back”
Young dudes like “He crazy he snap”
I'm like thank you but facts is most of yall be on bullshit
Really I'm just tryna find a cade to detach and wit my lady and snack on high class bourbon
My mass hurtin from pretendin that I ain't a maybe to snap
Coronavirus is only the first phase of attack
We ain’t prepared for what lays in our laps
And that’s because greed laid the table for that
And that's cause racism been enabling that
The whole time I was supposed to be okay with it
That’s that shit that be killin me
They said I was hatin
They told me “We don't wanna hear Nathan with raps”
They told me don't preach, they too lamen's for that
Put it in broader terms so they’ll play the shit back
And can't front but plenty times I been lazy to act, although I spoke it on wax
We ain't hopeless, we trapped
The doom impendin, room ascendin from a stake and relax
It's time to wake and be great
Or stay asleep and relapse, get back to waving these stacks
Let me know man
