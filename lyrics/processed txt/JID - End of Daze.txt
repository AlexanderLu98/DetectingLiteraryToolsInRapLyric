When I make it to the heavens, what's the code? Do I call a phone?
Security at the gate, no plus one, come all alone?
All along the race of life, I took a jog alone
Along the coast, I'm tryna cope, I raise a toast
And we consulted with the Most High
She told me watch my back, front, both sides
Hit a few baddies you never smashed 'fore y'all both die
Let the smoke rise, take the bodies to the crypts
And when the poor people run out of food, they can eat the rich
Plead the four-fifth, drop one, zombies on the block
See, I come with the shot, like Siakam, I pop
I got this Glock from my pops, it make the parking lot stop
We on the clock and time tock-tickin', have you forgotten that
