Uh, ain't no Ls on my jacket
The MAC-11 hit your melon and crack it (Crack it)
Ain't no pads for that in that medicine cabinet (No)
Can't mess with whatever's in that gelatin tablet (Fuck that)
Ten metal fragments can flip your skeleton backwards (Flip 'em)
All you seen after that was blackness (Mm)
This ain't no backpack shit, he slangs half a brick
Bitch, you need to ease back a bit, the trench has cactus pins (Ow)
The seats in the Benz Lenny Kravitz skin, don't get your cabbage split (Tan shit)
It don't matter what establishment, we in it (We gettin' shipped the fuck out)
Always get the biggest chicken wing, you don't get to eat on one onion ring
At least a hundred Jesus links underneath the mink
Yellow Bugatti look like a bumblebee
Compressor on the front to muffle the heat
The submachine gun, it come with the beam amongst other things that's unseen
To run with me, you need sunscreen cream, see I'm covered in bling (Bling)
Motherfucker, ain't no shade, even under the trees where monkeys swing (Ah-ah-ah)
The marijuana money green, I'm runnin' the company like a drug ring
Livin' comfortably off of gut instinct
That fell upon me once I was done with the streets (Uh)
You still scheme in public, P, let me bring you up to speed
You get your wig spun like a tumbleweed in Belize, I get on the beat and bleed (Bleed)
Sacrifice of livin' and bein' to please deities
Them were VVs, flood the big Nefertiti piece (Ayo)
