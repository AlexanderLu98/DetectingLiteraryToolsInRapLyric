Ain't no question, I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Not the one for testing
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act
Ha, I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds up in the state of paranoia
I told him if you're scared, go get a dog, so by tomorrow
You'll prolly see twenty rappers walking with Rottweilers
Your gimmick is primitive and impotent, you won't win with it
So limit it before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me you found yourself bleeding internally
Now all you heads is learning see
I stay in there sincere, you commence prayer
Your heart begets fear 'cause there ain't no wins here
Huh never kid 'cause even with leverage
I can rock your domepiece worse than the wop ever did
What?

Ask me to blast, no need to ask 'cause I'm mashing
Peeping the latest fashion, copy-cats and plastics
Get me to flashing my adversaries shipped in caskets
Murdered them bastards, witness the past, got Boombastic
Now that they freed me, no one can see me
I completely eradicated my competition, Father forgive me
Assemble the troops, prepare my loots for combustion
Rushing them motherfuckers, the deadliest nigga busting
How can they touch me when they lost in thought?
On Death Row we lock shit down across the board
Now flash and watch me get in that ass like a bikini
Lyrical legendary so niggas will never see me
Completely defeat me, can never happen, whether rapping or scrapping
Niggas get smashed on they motherfucking back
Hard to kill, and even harder to stop
Watch Kane and 'Pac drop the sho' shot! Tell 'em motherfuckers

Let me just send the plan to put the cash in the hand
So that I can spend a grand of Benjamins up in Japan
Oh Yin's the man and therefore my Luchi eating sushi
Checking out a subtitled movie featuring Sho Kosugi
Tell me, Kane, when will niggas learn?
In this game, fuck with us, niggas getting burned
We takin' turns on you bitch-made niggaros
I hope it hurts 'cause you're worst than these groupie hoes (Oh one more time baby)
I'll be forever, the go-getter of the cheddar
Thinkin' ahead of my competitor, just too clever to sever
I got it together to represent with my true nigg
The first syllables of our name together is 2 Big
Think about that!
