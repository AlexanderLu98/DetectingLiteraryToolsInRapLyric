If you ever want for anything to work, you gotta try
You gotta live like you dying in a minute, take your time
Use it wise, dream higher than "The Ribbon in the sky"
Don't gotta take my advice, you know, who the fuck am I? (Yeah, who the fuck are you?)
But just a little fly, finding smells through a shitty walk of life
Or Walter Payton on the sideline, the pie line is mine
In my mind, I try to see myself through God eyes
Fuck a guideline or tour guide, nobody helped me, but Iâ€™m not fine
God got me, but if not, then this nine got me
Nah, Akhi, this bird shit, you pop cocky
I gotta get the mop, they tryna leave the boy sloppy
Slip once then it's my fault, second time, then you got me fucked up
Tried ending it and knock me off my rocker, tough luck
Kick my ass, let me run it back, that was tough love I was raised on
