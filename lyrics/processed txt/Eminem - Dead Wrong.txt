There's several different levels to Devil worshipin'
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket â€” I'm lyin', I got a .9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours
Yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth!
I'm dead wrong!
