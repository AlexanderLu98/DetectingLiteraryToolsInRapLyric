Champagne wishes and caviar dreams
A team that's gettin' C.R.E.A.M
With sales of fishscales from triple beams
I gleam, livin' the life of Riley, packin' fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos, just me and my dino primo
Pushin' Bimm-o's, then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas — he runs the whole staff
We count math from steam baths
We've seen Half-a-Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major playas gettin' papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin' targets soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us, try to beat us — we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders lookin' straight charmin' in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas?
You gots to come get through our whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin' mad payola
Slangin' that coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jax, but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing, son
