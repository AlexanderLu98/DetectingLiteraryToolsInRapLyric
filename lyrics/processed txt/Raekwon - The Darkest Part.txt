Boy grown, hands like Roy Jones
King Tut bracelet on, encrusted, flooded in stones, bro
Hardest and the sharpest, merge like three-bedroom apartments
Pick one room, they all boom, let me start this
My art retarded, kids, the arsonist and ostrich
The moon is the part, we been partners, shit
Say no other, we the Jungle Brothers out in Kenya
How we did in December loadin' them cartridges
The lines is like nines, P80s, mean babies
Word to mama, poor llamas, paper we seein' crazy
Louis Rich, he the drummer
Thoughts from the black boy, boy, mama call ya
See the numbers stay maxin' and relaxin'
Truck jewelry and 2020 seven Hummers, we saw
I seen your stunters gettin' busy on the bridge
Headed out fleein'
You're dope D'ing, stop wasting time, take some shine
