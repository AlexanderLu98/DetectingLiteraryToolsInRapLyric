In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam
Destiny lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the Izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars (A few cars)
And I kick a few flows so I could pick a few hoes (A few hoes)
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm quick to bust if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows (Castro)
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killing shit
Oops, Cristal keep spilling, shit, you overdid it, holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie, baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did, quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me, the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White
