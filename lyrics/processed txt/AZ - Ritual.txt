When I rhyme, it's like the city is mines
Play who? No label ain't give me a dime
Came through like if you grateful, this how you really should shine
Flooded Jesus in that grey coupe at the grittiest times
They know me, since '96, wrist was lit with a Rollie
Speak of bricks, been in the mix, ain't shit you can show me
A king occasionally seen, stay in the wings
The success'll be when you closer with folks sprayin' them things
In new Celine, the Louis mask over thе grill
Do the math, ain't gotta ask, nigga holdin' for real
The omеn is sealed, I'm pardoned, back sucker duckin' and dodgin'
Fire spitter, who could fuck with the arson?
I'm neutral, never frugal, salute you if the feelin' is mutual
Play cuckoo, niggas comin to roof you
The true school, the vet and the Ghost involved
Out of respect, still connect with the older gods
It's no façade, I rep it, my style is perfected and epic (Yeah)
Not a blemish, let me finish my breakfast (Brrt, uh)
