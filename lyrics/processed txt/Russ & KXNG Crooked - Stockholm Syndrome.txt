This is bigger than a post with an irrelevant caption
This is organized knowledge and intelligent action
This is since '06, tryna create legacy
Boss talks, stocks, real estate, and equity
You fake Pat Beverleys always tryna shut down Russ
You foul, stay the fuck from 'round us
'Cause you can't fuck with me so you lie instead
You lazy, you Blac Chyna head
But I can't give 'em clout, that's a courtesy bag
Can't forget how bad I wanted what I currently have
Selective memory, I'm blocking all the bad games out
Even though I got more fuck-ups than a halfway house
But since the masks came out, I've made M after M
You not a boss (Nah) you get your percent after them
That's rough (Yeah) money slowin' up, no more audience
The Fashion Nova ads and OnlyFans made it obvious
I'm sorry but I'm not (Not) my sentiment is
Is y'all stay throwin' shots so you can get what you give
Fuck you back then, right now and tomorrow (Haha)
I'm high in Africa, smokin' Kilimanjaro
I'm a young god (Yeah) but still I bleed
So I don't post where I'm at (Uh) until I leave
And they killin' Black people like it's nothin
Actually it's past the point of killing, this is hunting
Gotta do something (Something) gotta do my part (Yeah)
So I went and raised a half a million for the cause (Yeah)
Shout out to the ones on the frontlines gettin' they fight on
I'm talkin 'bout Tamika, I'm talkin 'bout Mysonne
I'm keepin' the lights on for my whole damn family
So I don't give a fuck if some hoes can't stand me
I still want Grammys, tell the chapters
Artists go broke 'cause they sell the masters
You a player, I'm an owner so I'm richer than most
How you diss me in a song and you sittin' in coach?
The audacity (Shh) I'm getting tired of y'all
Keep it real, deep down, I'm inspiring y'all
You know the show biz says don't plan real idiots
My goal is buy land, build businesses
And my lawyer and my manager are Ashkenazi
Building empires like Ghazi Shami
Skin real smooth, but my wrist is rocky
I don't want the pussy if you drink Dasani
Lookin in the mirror like I knew we'd make it (Knew it)
500,000 for the Boosie bracelet
Another 100,000 for the MJ hoops
Success came true, ooh
Different colors, I know you gonna remember these eyes
I could give a fuck less if an enemy dies
Fuck them, fuck you, hut one, hut two
Set, hike, hand it off to myself, run through
All the obstacles, I'm always callin' audibles
My come up is phenomenal, I feel like I'm responsible
For artists tryna do it they own way and move at they own pace
It's you versus you dawg, you runnin' your own race
I'm locked in, after this, I'm top ten dead or alive
You better decide which side of the fence you reside
'Cause I don't fuck with the back and forth
I make a bitch go get it like a Labrador
I'm a Platinum plaque ambassador
'Cause I don't got one career dawg, I mastered four
But I'm not done yet (Nah) the critical thought is
The industry is run by invisible bosses
Through the midst of the fog, I can see what's true
Only way to beat the game is don't play it, fuck you, come on

One of the best to ever do it, on G-O-D
Twenty plus in the game, yellin', "C-O-B"
'Cause the industry is all about who dicks who
Who broomsticks who
With no Vaseline, they just move shit through
Nigga, who is you? They gon' screw him too
You came into this game to be a cool rich dude
Eatin' Ruth Chris food, buy your new bitch a new Shih Tzu
But the true issue, they gon' twist you like a Rubik's Cube
Then they kickin' you out quicker than jiu-jitsu
Nigga, boo-hoo-hoo
Ain't nobody cryin' when all of a sudden your career doesn't exist
Couple of hits you don't own, got you stuck in a ditch
Wonderin' if you should end it all, cuttin' your wrists
Sick of diggin' in your pocket, touchin' nothin' but lint
Wonderin' where the fuck your publishin' went, a hundred percent
To the company, and now you livin' under a bench
Unless a nigga like Hov wanna come to a brother defense (Ahh)
Poor us, only the money can cure us
Jimmy Henchman puttin' coke on the tour bus
The allure of gettin' rich is what lured us
Into that trap of bein' rappers slash trappers
If they clap us, the label is gettin' fat 'cause
They assure us but never ensured us
That we would get a piece of the pie
Seem like we got the green light to die (Sure does)
I used to sit low in my '64
With my pistol on my hip, yo
Gettin' hypno-tized by the Cisco
I would sip slow 'til I was sick, yo
Head throwing up out the window
Didn't know how to get home, when I did though
I would tip-toe to my crib 'fore I let the shit pour
To my bottle, oh, then I was Guantánamo
I would get low like a schizo' on Skid Row
Drinkin' myself in the grave, depressed person
Now I don't chase Henny, I chase the best version
Of myself, I'll be in the CLS swervin'
Rims so big, look I'm in an Excursion
I'm hardworkin' and God workin'
Like a heart surgeon, my heart's urgin'
I was Kunta Kinte now I'm Geordi La Forge
Slaveship to the spaceship, damn I'm LeVar Burton
Open the stargate and I'ma chill wit' ISIS
Wrote a letter to Suge sayin', "I'm still the nicest"
'Til it's over, I'll be grippin' the pistolas
Sippin' some Crip Cola, right where Killer Mike is
Leavin' the mic lifeless that's what's killin' mics is
Hail to the lyricists, we're gonna be from the Genesis
Your emphasis is money but you really just a dummy
The labels the ventriloquists, here's what the real advice is
Before the jewelry, get some real estate
Put some lawyer money up like you dealin' weight
Keep it a hunnid, G, whoever wanna eat
Tell 'em all, "Bring somethin' to the dinner plate" (Word)
Get your credit straight, nigga, meditate
Keep a shooter that'll never, ever hesitate (Boom, boom)
Remember this jewel in the future
Keep one step like Medusa, ahead of snakes
