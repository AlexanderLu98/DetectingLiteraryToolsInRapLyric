When you way up high in your prayed up sky
Displayed trust they cut, then your days must die
First you're flying up, up away, then you dying another day
Not aligned with kindness, the denying of what you say
I've been dope for a long time, collaboration's a long line
People ringing the phone line, 'cause they really want N9ne, love is the shown sign
But the blown minds over time they coming at you with the wrong kind of еnergy like an enеmy condone crime
Wanna finish me but infinity, my song shine
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
How they wishin' the six feet below for me
When I'm giving them respect and dough for B
Make you never wanna connect with people socially
Gotta lay low 'cause outta nowhere, no fair, people turn on you like Fredo
Hit you with the Draco
They'll erase your day bro, the evil wanna come and try to take your halo
