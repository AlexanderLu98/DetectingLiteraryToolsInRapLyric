Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
I'm still buzzin', this is Hennessey the next morning
They upset talking, I'm yes y'allin for checks
Boss on the set, you acting like my ex calling
Ain't that a bitch, not the five or the six
I rock seven on my back, that's Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion, I ain't having it
S-I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, what's happening?
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
Four, five, six, your head's crackin'
Just a fifth of E&J, plus a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make 'em lean
I'm running with the real, y'all chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for they favorite team
