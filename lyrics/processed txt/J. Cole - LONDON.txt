Plane just landed, Heathrow, hop off the G4 standard
We see a opp, it's G-code, we blow his top, now he's volcanic
Please don't panic over my lingo, both of my feet so planted
Gold wedding ring on my finger, but yet I'm still killin' 'em singlehanded
Drum on the gun like I'm Ringo
I'm in this bitch with no chain like I'm Django
We from the ends where they know that they can't go
She go both ways so I'm tastin' the rainbow (Ha)
Yummy, they got no more bread, they're crummy
The same way that Melo was starin' at Rih is the way that I stare at the money
I'm ready to risk it all if I lift it, bet I won't miss it, you a statistic
Thought shit was sweet 'til we popped up and popped off the top of your Mistic
I go ballistic
Hopped out the drop, got the drop on an opp, now I'm opportunistic
I like to shop in the District
Coppin' this, coppin' that, I'm proper capitalistic, uh
Dreamer, Dreamer runnin' the game in my signature trainers
Balenciaga for joggers, I might just wear Crocs at the O2 arena
Splendid, got no limits, should have a tank on my pendant
Blokes goin' broke tryna keep up with Cole, but I make it back soon as I spend it
Maybach tinted, "'Scuse me, sir, but ain't that rented?"
I'm offended, straight cash for my Benzes, we don't pay back interest
Aim at fences when I swing, pay respects and kiss my ring
Even Elizabeth said I'm king, haha (Well he's bloody well right, isn't he? Haha)
Why would I choose between this one or that one
When I know that I can have both?
I laugh at these rappers for cappin'
I guess T.I.P. ain't the only one out here with jokes
Mans don't want smoke
