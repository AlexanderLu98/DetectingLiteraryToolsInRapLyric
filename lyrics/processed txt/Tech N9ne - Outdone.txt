Searched maps when I started to burst raps
1985, that's when I first snapped
Decades before they birthed apps
I was giving niggas, what did we call it back then? Dirt naps
But nowadays they still singing our praise
Know how to raise a lot of hell up, or else your crowd'll fade
Devour naysayers hatin', tryna set our cloud ablaze
My route'll stay electro-lit and Kali's my Powerade
And together we get paid in full (That's right)
For the cheddar, we big ragin' bulls
And it'll get Haitian cruel, meddling with pay and jewels
Enemies sit, laid in pools, hit 'em with a quick blazin' tool
He said he wasn't a fan of us, coming at me with a camera
See me and become a stammer-er 'cause I am the one with the stamina
I got the fully, I'm 'bout to be bully from KCMO and to Canada
You are the work of a janitor and I'm really coming to damage ya
Nobody wanna be showed up, they send me one verse and they hold up
I send 'em my verse and they go bust another verse after mine, it's a stole cut
'Cause they go nuts when a pro clutch microphones, givin' no fucks
'Cause I'm dope, plus, in my flow, trust, I got fo' sho' guts they get ate like a Po' Russ
From Jackstack (Yeah), the gat's back (Yeah)
When I'm out my town I get my Aventus right at Saks (Woo)
That smell and my riches will get your bitch's hat macked
Bosses take losses when you cross this black cat
And that's facts (Done)
Don't nobody want none 'cause (I can make you outdone)
Really wanna go flow with the gun? You niggas are just (Done)
When I'm doing it for fun, yo (I can make you outdone)
Doubt from when you slouched, what's the outcome? (Done)
When I go left and I'm speaking in tongues (I can make you outdone)
Ayy yatafawaq ealay-ha (Done)
Technician and independent number one (I can make you outdone)
You know the vibes, nigga
No drums, I still rock that bitch
The industry shunned me, but I got that stitch (Just one)
Eminem, Wayne, Kendrick and Pac's rap pick
Jahseh, Joyner, and Logic, too, so stop that shit
Acting like you don't see me in the conversation
Of the greatest, I never got a nomination
'Cause you hated, you callin' me abomination
When it was domination when you played it
How a nigga feeling outdone when you get him on a label with ya?
Get his clout sprung up, the louse hung up, your mouth guns at your picture
Now ain't that a kick in the sack? When I saw it, was fixing to snap
On a Gathering mission to pack 'em out, but Travis told us keep bickin' it back
So it let it go when I shoulda beheaded bro, 'cause I put him on a pedestal
As an incredible, I know he regret it, though
'Cause the bread, it goes dead, it sit low as your credit score
Man I'm so (Done)
Now I'm bitin' my thumbs 'cause (I can make you outdone)
Calling Kevin Wendell Crumb will never stop this beast
They know when I spit speech (I can make you outdone)
Shit gets deep
My talent gives some rappers shivers and it should (Yes, sir)
'Cause I kill it with some of the best spitters and it's good (That's right)
Guessing my sketching gets 'em stressing, they go left and feel threatened
Somethin' like police 'round niggas in the hood (Yeah)
White and black, mostly white, though (That's right)
With hundreds of years with beef, ain't no lipo (Nope)
The problem is no face to face, just Skype, yo (Bitch)
That's so cowardly, kinda like they did Iso (Woo)
No conversation, just left him for doing a song with me
All the ties from the other side was gone quickly
Tears flow here, bro, 'cause I ain't double-cross zero
We all know Mike Johnson is one of the fastest at rappin' and that ain't what I'm here for
I'm here for rockin' the spot (Yes, yes)
Not leaving your mothers with a coffin to drop
Anybody got a problem with me when your daddy was popping the twat?
Instead of inside her, shoulda took you and shot in a sock
