I ain't a hoodlum, they ain't arrest or murder me yet
Why ain't I Muslim? Jay Elec' ain't converted me yet
The chain immaculate, the plaque glisten the same as the jewelry
The pain is practiced, just sit back 'cause this shit came with the groupie
The stainless MAC tin clip attachment fit the frame of this Uzi
Just can't imagine it in the act of Chic to drain this jacuzzi
This ain't no actin', reenact the scripts, this ain't a real movie
This ain't no rapper switchin' to activist, this danger feel newbie
Hold up, diamonds got me seasick, pursuin' dreams
Tryna stop the street shit, exhuming kings
Imagine drinkin' three fifths to a human being
'Cause a human being deemed me three-fifths a human being
How much killin', dope, and dough I done mentioned?
Bros I convinced to go out on lynches
Even sister Kamala, Joe Biden henchman
Either niggas T'Challa or Josiah Henson
Slugs to whoever the fuck that loves you
This could get uglier than a Funk Flex love booth
Always coppin' fly shit, Adidas, Reeboks
On all they top five lists, just probably not B Dot's
