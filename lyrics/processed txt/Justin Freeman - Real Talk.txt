I wake up every morning at 6
Go into the garage and then sit, recording a mix
See what kind of lyrical murder I wanna commit
'Cause I can't get on a instrumental without slaughtering it
You see I've gotta commit in order to get
To where I wanna be in rap, yes, one of the sick-est
Rappers you ever heard, you see the moral is this
No calling it quits, 'cause one shot is all that you get
Lately I've been caught in a fit, honest I'm pissed
Feels like I'm cornered and hit by a mortar with bricks
Unfortunate situations got me on the defense
Hand-me-down clothes that I have to get taller to fit
Tryna convince the bank that I need longer to fix
The debts that I owe, saving every quarter and cent
They say the verses that I form is nothing short of a gift
It's sort of my niche, there's nothing more important than this
Balling my fist, man it's such a horror to list-
En to my mom struggle every day, the older she gets
But God is my witness, no I'm not a born-again Christian
But if it's real, then I hope the Lord's in her mist
I love her to bits, I used to eat porridge and grits
That pains me, but that's why I can no longer resist
The urge to kill rappers, Columbine sorta depicts
Of what'll happen if you step into my tournament, pricks
Just warning you kids, my portrait's not a portrait of bliss
Pure anger and love shortage is the source of my spit
I wanna show my mom that life of fame and fortune exists
Without having to sell my soul to get results or a hit
I never was the average horse in the fence, I jumped it and went
From a cul-de-sac to doing corporate events
It's straight grinding, no chances of aborting the mission at all
I'm speaking to the ones stuck in the mix, because
Everybody wants to be someone to somebody
And no one wants to be all alone on a long road
And nobody wants to be known as a nobody
Especially where the place that you've grown up is so cold
And yeah they throw sticks and stones at your body
But you can make the dark times golden in your soul
And if I flaked on you for a show, man, I'm so sorry
But if I never reach for my goals, then I won't know
