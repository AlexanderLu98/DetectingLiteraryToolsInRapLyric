For steady cash flows, niggas'll blast you past the Astros
Blow you like afros, the little fast hoes that last all the fast dough
They splash foes, red as Tabasco, they lay your asshole where the grass grow
Runnin' wit armies like they Castro
Them Donny Brasco's get Johnny Doj around they last holes
Keepin' em half froze, put in shiny boxes rockin' they last clothes
The cash close inside your top pocket of stashed roast
Body got found down on the back roads where all the trash blows
And broken glass globes, the dip chicks slicker than gastro
Who bag a slash blow and spot some top of the block hot as a gas stove
That's Mastro's cats in the Astros
Who ain't afraid ta let they gats go
The paper dash bros lovin' the flash though
And pass mo'
Stash rolls, count em like math pros
And crash low soda, PoPo's don't step all up in they path yo
Them cats go, that's smack on the back burner, but keepin' the gas low
When task rolls they snatch his ass mows, movin' too ass slow
