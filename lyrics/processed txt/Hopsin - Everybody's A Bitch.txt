Yo, don't even ask me (Nope)
Your ho in the backseat (Yup) I dove in it fastly
Oh she was nasty (Ooh)
Inappropriate ass cheeks (Ooh) I was hopin' to actually
Fill her jaw with all my testicle ooze
Film it all and maybe text it to you
I'm feelin' awesome, you should step in my shoes
I'm ill in Boston with the rest of my crew
You flexin' on who? (Who?) Try to start a problem with a nigga
Then you gon' be stuck (Gon' be stuck)
Somebody gotta end up on bottom
Man, I'm tellin' you, it won't be us (Won't be us)
Overly confident when I'm pulling up
On women as I hold these nuts (Oh he's nuts)
I talk a little gibberish
Then get inside that pussy with the OG thrust
I wrote this dope, just hope it flows to pay off
Wrote this coast to coast provokin' chaos
Folks suppose the closest clone is Adolf
Don't get close 'cause bones get broke and ate off (Yikes!)
Rockin' all black like Batman (Batman)
Slap a nigga with a back hand (Back hand)
I'm swaggin' on your motherfuckin' rap clan (Rap clan)
I see through you niggas like a CAT scan
I've been the truth since fourteen
Been on and always let loose with mo' steam
Lit like a nigga off juice and codeine
Breakin' all laws, actin' rude to police
Bitch, here's a nut you can use for protein
Y'all niggas don't be producin' no heat
I ride the beat smooth and cruise it slowly
Fuck jewels and Rollies, bitch niggas, all you below me
