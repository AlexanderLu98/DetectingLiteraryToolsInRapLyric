Know your roots and who you rootin' for (Word)
KRS Two (Uh)
I kept the intelligent movement in route thus far (Yeah)
Hope you don't mind that I do
Not like I needed approval from you or somethin' (Nah)
I took a spoonful of the puddin'
The proof was put in, the truth is digustin' (Yuck)
Your views amuse my vision, your outlook funny
I had to enrich my sense without no money
But now we get into it, it's more than music to flow with me
I'm gonna need to see a quote from my quotes, that's poetry (Yeah)
They know me globally, from the omens I've spoken openly
Not 'cause I pose to be what they told me I'm 'posed to be
Hopefully niggas get the memo and don't take it out of context (Uh)
We ain't on the same page, check my table of contents
Stop it, I'm well read like the Nickerson Gardens
Straight out of Carson, play your cards or get discarded
I ain't the type of artist to be disregarded
This what art is, simple as that, shut up and rap
Where the lyricists at? (*Cricket chirp*) How sad
Your clique ain't on top of the game, that's just a mousepad (Uh)
They want the old Soul, I can't deny my ascension
They want the branzino, but they ain't tryna go fishin'
I took the scenic route, made wrong turns, I let y'all have y'all turn
But I thought long-term so I can teach 'em how
Virtuous patience is, I believe that (Yeah)
Remember that you can't just win, they gon' want a rematch (Uh)
A lot of people that you connect with need to be detached
The fame may go to your head, most of it be cap (Facts)
Mind over matter, respect the telekinetics
I move a mountain 'bout a mile 'cause I said it
The rapper's rapper, Black Lip Pastor, the prophet, the God
Playin' fetch with blank checks at the top with my dawgs
Who want what? (Huh) Nobody, I'm 'bout to go potty
That shit, I'm kickin' it, but I don't know no karate
No need for cold feet, I ain't playin' no hockey
'Specially when effortlessly the flow is Mojave (Yeah)
Underground emperor, my ring need kisses
Every move is calculated like we teach physics
Eat a rapper, have 'em cease existence
Then catch a attitude, 'cause now I gotta clean these dishes, Soul
