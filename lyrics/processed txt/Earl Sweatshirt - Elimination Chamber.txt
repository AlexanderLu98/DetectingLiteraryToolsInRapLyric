This that thirty-deep-in-Saugus shit
Fire-starter squadron, dodgin' coppers sinceâ€”
Ask her why she dropping, cuz, it's probably 'cause he prodigious
Pay the rent easy, leave the bank cheesy
And bass leave your face greasy, artisan, paint easy
Thick bristle type nigga on a bitch steez
Stanzas diesel like Vic Tanny on a fritz,
Whoops, system overload, itchin' for a foe to poach
Spittin' like the engine on a motherfuckin' motorboat
Gold glisten under overcoat
Missin' all affection for these niggas
Redirectin' all these niggas
Very literal, type to sip the Mickeys out of cereal
Drunk and driving, twisty, how he inked up in the swimming pool?
Hundred stand against me, I'm a menace, void a villain, sue me
Driving into fences 'cause I hit the whip a little woozy
Bitch, I'm busy cruising, 'scuse me
