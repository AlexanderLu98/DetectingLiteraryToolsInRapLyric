Why would I ever have to cop a chain again
When the QB chain birthed most the chains in the game?
No post office was stampin' time
Took out a slice out of the Big Apple, made apple pies, family sized
Leather bombers and Nike Sacais
Dangerous corners, you better pray that tomorrow arrives
Rap Sugar Ray Robinson, nothin' sweet
Y'all too out of shape to even box with me
Heavyweight, I know my way around the ring
Just like shawty know her way around the store
Makin' hits with Hit-Boy, all he gotta do is hit record
Record breakin' news, had to show up just to fill a void
Confused spoiler, oh, boys, y'all better keep your poise
Leave me out of the weasel shit
Be cool when you see me, I'm higher than all that rap diva shit
The hood know you pussy so we don't buy or believe in it
Locked in on the instrumental, I took back the key to this, uh
