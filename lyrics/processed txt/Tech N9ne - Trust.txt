Tech N9na, next king up
Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer
That lingua vexing ya
Leavin' a regular rapper resting, bruh (Chyeah)
This is what, I give it such
An incredible wicked rush, a vivid gush
Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff
Said, I better go rip it rough and I lit it up
The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (Whoop)
Lyrically elect me, Jet Li
The beat, it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (Whoop)
That is tellin' me "Let's feed"
On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus
Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest
Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive
A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (Chyeah)
The boogie monster reppin' with NF in the hoodie
Want to step into the session and fully conquer
The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (Chyeah)
Left in a wreck, never checkin' nor could he stomp us
Take his crown
Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakeish frown
Shake his ground
Like I'm the Mechagodzilla, I'm such a killer when I break it down (Uh)
These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes
That need those elite bros with the heat, so
They can eat on the D low
Off a beast yo' ego, got it vetoed (Chyeah)
Please close your beak foes, delete scrolls
Taken from me, thieves chose to try to decode (Chyeah)
Reload the beat, so I can reach each soul
No cease, no finito, release (Go!)
I am the chosen and everyone is beholdin'
My energy is golden 'cause dominion is being broken
From enemies in the open approachin', I'm never jokin'
The remedy bein' spoken, I'm hopin' that you're soakin' it up (Chyeah)
I'm in the motion, I'm dope and I'm never chokin'
My devotion to floatin' like an ocean, the Holy Ghost and
I'm scopin' the evil folk and revokin' the wicked notion
I'm croakin', I'm really floatin' and quotin' that I'm closin' it up (Chyeah)
Talkin' behind my back
End up where N9ne is at see me and say
Kinda wack, you could not find the knack
Hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray
I'ma beat you 'cause I'm greedy and slay, if you're creepy and cray
I'ma eat you like PB&J, kiwi and grapes
I'ma demolish 'em when the T be in play, pray!
A stunna recordin' in my number three Jordans
Dungaree sportin', the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin'
The punishin' hunter eat like a hung-ary orphan (Chyeah)
T9 and NF are elephants
In the room without a closet for skeletons
Quit embellishin', a demon from hell is sent
Yell it went, Donny, you're outta your element!
