, rhymin' whole sentences, crime with no witnesses
Mind your own business if your eyes behold me killing the sickest lines with no censorship
Fighting that like uncle Luke
Like you snort Hennessy, every line's a 100 proof and provin' they the fucking truth, praying for my enemy
Catch me out east in a dickie suit and a bubble goose, knuck if you buck nigga, ridin' with my gangsta boots
Cigar in my mouth, bucket hat with the kangaroo
Fuck you rappers, I came for you
Guns are blastin', my aim is true
Lucky bastard you made it through
Fuck your facts where I’m from
Tuckin' ratchets is the thing to do
I ain’t the same as you
I fuck with classics, the track will get dumped in acid I slay the groove
Prayers up for my niggas who didn’t make it
Prayer rug in the basement we famous and livin' sacred
But humans are still sinnin', women strip to the anklet
It’s like the new renaissance picture bitches naked, I’m
At the Trump national, I’m playing some golf in a dashiki vibranium in the cloth I ain’t a lost nigga
The skin I’m in is so ancient remain a boss nigga, gave you a deal and a bag you became a soft nigga
Cut off my water them chickens will go to Mexico, to feds on my nuts like tentacles on my testicles
Kill a flow made me legend so, in the coast with a sexy ho
Rock a fur in December identical to a Eskimo
I’m in my condo, bumping Quando Rondo
Any John fuck with my dough gonna be a John Doe
Love that young and wild shit, but I want all my young niggas to make it out the game
Enjoy your money and fame my nigga
G shit we came here on a sea ship
Shackles on our feet, now it’s crackin'
We get eating is the shit I feed the streets with
Fu-Gee-La beat flip, freestyle, tattoo the only time I ain’t drip
The West is hot will the W be destroyed
I bet it’s not see the W’s we enjoy
Respect the block at the W we the boys
Connect the dots that’s W. E. B. Du Bois, homie
Black and prominent, Wyclef Jean in it
Designer Denim never recessive them genes dominate
I don’t spit a 16, I vomit it
West coast like a purple and gold Laker jersey with Lebron in it
So honor it
