Ayo, I shoulda been out, I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin', I'ma try yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out, I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where emcees get slain
Where thugs'll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT, yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it, left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin', mad singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer with us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' "Free L!"
