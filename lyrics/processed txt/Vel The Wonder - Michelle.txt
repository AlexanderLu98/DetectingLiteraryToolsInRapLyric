I drop a buster on his forehead
I am solo on my team, I am more than
This the miseducation of my core fan
I am total mayhem, I am Lauren
Big hook Bianca bussin’, fussin’ a lot
Brianna beating on these bitches with a Bus on her top
Beatrice a busy bone buzzin’ to top
Baby Brenda had a boy like she fuckin’ a lot
On my mama, I am appeased to feed the drama
Dalai Lama, let me find my peace or sayonara
Michelle Obama, I will feed the kids what I can offer
Let yo bitch step to me if she want proper
I mean some pressure, temp is rising, no need to measure
My rendition of heaven exceeds the pleasure
I am always on time, I can’t be the never
I am Hell on Earth, I can be forever
One time, one time for the Hot Girl
I can tell you in a second what you not, girl
I think you bettin’ on a lot, boy
Block toys, I'ma have to knock you from the top, boy
Bangin’ bodies, painted mammy's who like to make some money
Raise her honey, pretty bones who out to face the funny
I can see what really makes them hungry
You tryna intervene on my scene, wanna take it from me?
