I was born runnin' with the baton
Now I'm known as the young intellectual don
Until I'm gone, where I'm from, the real don't get along
With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne, overlookin' my empire, uh, uh

Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh

So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the lobsters, huh
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the...

It's the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$
Who you mad at? They ain't have to ask that
Attack with the backlash, where's my cash at?
Runnin' all through NASDAQ, strap in my backpack
Goin' off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac
Havin' flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back
Hit 'em with the blackjack, goin' through a stack fast
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back
Niggas get smacked with the realer
When I drop, it's all killer, no filler
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya
And when it hit ya, it's no warnin'
We bombardin', me and my squadron
If you want it, get your army
We droppin' bombs calmly
This is no party
