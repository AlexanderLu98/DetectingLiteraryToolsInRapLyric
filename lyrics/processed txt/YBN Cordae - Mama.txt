Mama look what you created, now I'm super faded
And I'm truly hated 'cause I'm real rich
But she too elated 'cause she knew we made it
Got the Louis sueded on some trill shit
I be coolin', nigga, making stupid figures
But the truth is realer than the fake shit
Know they shoot to kill us, and produce the triggers
I go two gorillas on some BAPE shit
Look at all the fame and the fortune, the pain and extortion
The Range and the Porsches, the same, but it's gorgeous
Mama called me, said your name on the Forbes list
Thank God your daddy never paid for abortion
But sharing clothes, good times, I'ma cherish those
Now I'm stuck doing Paris shows
Embarrass hoes on carousels, I'm careless though
I bear the toe, don't tear your soul
