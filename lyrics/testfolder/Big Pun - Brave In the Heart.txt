We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps - state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, La Cosa Nostra dough
Hold your toaster low; business, never personal
Just some words to know if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state; If death is my fate, then cool, I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
A'ight, crew? (No doubt, Pun!)
A'ight then, let's fight then, I'm hypin'
Comin' with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto god
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream "Terror Squad!"
We larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she’d starve when I die, understand I’m like God in her eyes
The Father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin, that's mi hermano
