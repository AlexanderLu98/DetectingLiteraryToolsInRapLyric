1 ContributorEvil Lyrics(Verse 1: sKitz Kraven)

Back from causing cardiac arrest
I got an S up on my chest
I feel Superman
The way I’m saving rap with every breath
I know your pressed
I’m never stressed
No that’s a lie
I’m always stressed
I’m fucking stressing out right now
I need a pill to wash it down
I just graduated from rehab
But I’m really high right now
I took a heroine needle
And stuck it in my eye right now
I feeling shy right now
But I still use my voice
When on the mic
Yo sKitz fuck you
You’re fucking trash
Plus you’re white
Damn you’re right
Guess I need to kill again
To take their skin
I need to sew it on so carefully
My needles vеry thin
I need a needle full of bins
I mean a bin that’s full of needles
Swap thе needles with fermeldahyde
And now I’m bathing people
Lately I’ve been hearing that they pissed at me
Kraven why you singing
All them mother fucking love song’s
You know
I make music from the heart
You fuckin pussy
What you talkin bout
Got a problem with my process
We can talk it out
Matter of fact no we ain’t talkin
We can sock it out
Surgically remove both of your knees
Then have you walk it out
Pussy
Tryna play me like a bitch
No I ain’t going
I’ll slap your baby momma like a pimp
Until she hoeing
You might also like(Chorus: sKitz Kraven)

These people
Want me to be lethal
But when I show them lethal
They get scared and say I’m evil
I swear these people
Want me to be lethal
But when I show them lethal
They just say I’m E-
They say I’m evil

(Verse 2: Jarren Benton)

Bitch I’m Evil
Something wrong
But it’s cerebral
Fuck doing all that talkin
Send me the addy
And I’ll come meet you
I don’t trust none of these bitches
Some of these hoes
Can be deceitful
Watch who you call friends
Cuz some of these niggas heads
Ain’t see through
Oh they counted me out
When I fell back
I had to regroup
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Solo dolo
I don’t need you
Pistol by my side
Like R2-D2
It ain’t peaceful
I just tipped the bouncer in this bitch
To sneak my heat through
Who you tryna preach to
It’s on sight bitch when I see you
He could be in a preschool
Or a cathedral
I won’t keep cool
I don’t care if you’re
Christian Muslim Hebrew
I’m letting this heat loose
We feed rats to sharks
We turn his bitch ass into seafood
Catch me driving drunk
In a red Porsche
Ill nigga I pop a cork
For all of my dead corpse
Worse comes to worse
I’m hooded and masked up
You a day and a dollar short
I just gave out my last fuck
Bitch
(Chorus: sKitz Kraven)

These people
Want me to be lethal
But when I show them lethal
They get scared and say I’m evil
I swear these people
Want me to be lethal
But when I show them lethal
They just say I’m E-
They say I’m evilEmbed
