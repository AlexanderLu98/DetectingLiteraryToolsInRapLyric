42 ContributorsBoom Lyrics[Chorus: Token]
Roll through the city with the vroom, vroom
I got hoes tryna get me in a room, room
I get low and they hit me with the zoom, zoom
(Oh my God, Ronny)
I got foes and the semis and the deuce, deuce
Like

[Verse 1: Token]
She wanna jump in the back, feel like a poncho
Leave with a couple of scratch, shout out to Dcaso
Keys, I don't know what they are, I just click shit
People wanna put me in charge, I do big shit
Weed in a couple of jars, it’s for the homie though
Least five bitches look at me like I'm their Romeo
Knee high boots, I think she 'bout to join a rodeo
Levi’s tighter than a knot when you board a boat (Fuck!)
Board the boat, cold flow, four below
Lil' mixed bitch, she a (Oreo)
She used the DiGiorno's, flew her out to Milan
Now she take a pic of every plate she 'bout to eat on, we on, man
What the fuck is it, really?
Came a long way from takin' two trains to the city
Two chains to the titty, Wu-Tang to the C.R.E.A.M
Liu Kang 'cause she flew two legs for the kiddie, feel me?

I get low and they hit me with the zoom, zoom
I got foes and the semis and the deuce, deuce

[Verse 2: JID]
My brother finna get it in blood and you gotta pay for it
Finna hit the bank in a minute to get a bankroll
Jiddy a idiot, just a nigga like the Django
But got the too-too-too-too (To kill Thanos)
I'm doing my thang though
Don't be thinking I’m playing though
Animation to animal and my nature is a beast
And no nation, lil’ crazy nigga runnin' round naked
With his stick, takin’ shits, servin' fiends out the vacant
By the basement, niggas lookin' outta space
I been outta place the wrong time in the right state of mind
Tryna multitask the page to a dollar sign
'Fore they toe my tag, she thought it was a taser
I don’t know karate, so I must be crazy
Nigga, what's crackin', what's poppin'? Wes Craven
If you cross my dog, nigga been barkin' all day and
I keep a K9, it got the power like Kanan
[Chorus: Token]
Roll through the city with the vroom, vroom
I got hoes tryna get me in a room, room

[Verse 3: Token & Rico Nasty]
Top-top of the line, I feel like Pluto
Drop-top in the mine, right next to Hublot
Cop-coppin' a dime, so bad she evil
Sloppy-toppy and the hottie nastier than Rico (Yeah)
Made her boujie, now she wants the sushi with the tobiko (Yeah)
Freaky little bitch, she wear choker like she emo (Yeah)
Liquor in the body, body feels like it's a hero (Yeah)
Hit 'em and they end up with a Stitch without the Lilo (Woah!)
Oh, my baby like Tito, but she horny off the Henny
If I sold a couple hoodies, could afford a new Bentley
Empty cups around the room, I guess we pourin' too many
Tryna cop the suicidals like my door's too heavy
Tryna cop another crib, it's like the one I got broke
Got her bouncin' up and down, it's like she jumpin' jump rope
Drum hit 'em like "Ba-ba-bam, ba-ba-bam", ho
Pink's better, but I get redder with the heat close
[Chorus: Token]
Roll through the city with the vroom, vroom
I got hoes tryna get me in a room, room
I get low and they hit me with the zoom, zoom
I got foes and the semis and the deuce, deuce
