4 ContributorsSpeech Unleashed Lyrics[Intro: Spec Mata]
Ladies and gentlemen, for years you've heard of the supreme lyrical entity that has roamed the Earth leaving a path of verbal destruction in the aftermath
Well tonight you will see him live on this very stage
But I have to warn you, he's not here because he wants to be
We've captured him and brought him here so that we can witness his displays of word mastery with our own eyes
He's very angry, so we've placed a protective barrier between the stage and your seats in hope that no one will be harmed
Despite these efforts, we urge you to be very careful because we don't know what he's capable of
So without further ado...
Oh no, he's got loose!

[Verse: K-Rino]
You need to know my flows hit you like real stout blows
I'll punch a calendar and knock a month out cold
Your image as a whole I'll quickly denounce, I'll clown and sweep through each bounce
You'll need a 7 digit scoreboard to keep count
It's true no one can do it like I do
Drive by at a 100 miles an hour in a ride and high five you
And crack you 'cause you thought you was hot
The mystic warlock who could snatch a keyhole from off of a lock
When I blatantly concentrate you couldn't whip me with a Tec
I'm an animal plus I'm sick, somebody take me to the vet
Right after I spoke a note, these jokers openly repost
I speak multiple vocals, the locals think I've got three throats
My pen and pad goes in agg mode
Before I open up my folder I type a million character passcode
Then I sip Habanero Tabasco, my past flows are so well composed
They're known to make lightning flash slow
And it's apropos to cause fiascos
I laugh knowing I hold loads of nuclear weapons under my bathrobes
I set fire to mics and drive slow
We can travel the Glasgow as long as I let my mom and my dad know
Water I'm breathing under, come do you believe in wonders?
Why? 'Cause I'm the one who invented an odd even number
I just had to assassinate you for standing and laughing
I'll savagely decapitate you then hand you an aspirin
Defeat my team, yeah I see you homie, at least you're dreaming
I'm a beast, they doused me in hot grease and the grease was screaming
Your people feinding for concepts with a deeper meaning
My line scheme got 'em seeing secretly reconvening
High frequency thinking, cerebrally linking each who syncing
Unequalled achievements, bilingually speaking street and English
The deepness of it couldn't be corrupted
Shuffle up the words inside a book I never read and watch me reconstruct it
This new breed could never consume me
If I get mad I won't storm out the room, I'll make the room leave
Bars without a limit, no measure to the total that's been expended
The doctor told me my throat canal had an engine in it
And since you think your skills are so hot I'll roast you on the spot
And take what's left back home in a to-go box
See I'm that guy who you should leave alone
I'll sneak in your deepest cerebral zone and play your secrets on speaker phone
It's true I'm forming a new mind
So many multiples and group rhymes you'll find a whole 16 inside 2 lines
I told ya I'm a fully loaded bazooka holder
Blow off ya shoulders, you won't have nothing to look over
No escaping tonight, I'll go make a device
That will seek and verify your location precise
Snatch up a life, every member of your house gets tortured
The missing poster will look just like a family portrait
When I go to bed, sweet phrases develop in my sleep
And when I wake up complete pages are all over the sheets
I come with ripping intentions, spit with different equipment
I was given infinite mental dimensions as an infant
When I architect, each part is hectic
So infectious that a sleep narcoleptic would restart the record
For trickery I snatch you wickedly and hit you so horrifically
It split you into 63 different ethnicities
While I walk now with great wisdom endowed
Standing crowds, speaking silently and listening loud
Who can be as electrifying as me?
Vision a top MC of the highest degree and multiply him by 3
It's not known my bodies made of solid stone
So my collarbone got a lot of hydraulics to carry all the knowledge on
Down to the subject, you a clown and a puppet
I accomplish more than you when I'm being counterproductive
My sound is destructive, no outlet in the town can disrupt it
Underground yet oceanic, so you drown if you touch it
A mountain of grudges from old beefs found in my clutches
Expound and you love it, my head's big, the crown is above it
My treacherous message pops ya like a pressure washer
I'll mop ya then disrespect your partner, chop and botch you like a reckless doctor
I'm seeing bloodbath signs, we'll play a game where we draft lines
And it takes 9 months to get to half time
