[Intro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
La, la
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse]
Walkin' with my back to the sun, keep my head to the sky
Me against the world, it's me, myself and I, like De La
Got in touch with my soul
Treadin' softly on the path down the rockiest road
Life isn't ice cream without Monopoly dough
The property grows in value, and rightfully so, I gotta have it
I see the way the people get treated, it's problematic
They ready to set us up for failure, it's systematic
But when I felt it, my eyes melted
The selfish are constantly profitin' off thе helpless
I'll nevеr do my team green, make the team green like the Celtics
The ones that ain't makin' it overzealous, they show and tell us
Throughout history, earnin' cheddar
They form and break out nickel-plated chrome Berettas
The same ol' story in a whole different era
I'm watchin' massacres turn to runnin' mascara, but anywho
For the pain, see what this Henny do
So we can see what lies beneath as we pour up a swig of truth
The sun sets as I sip a few
The sky turns a different hue farther from the color blue
The nighttime has arrived, I recline for the evenin'
I'm hawkin' down the next goal, the name's ain't Stephen
I started in a nightmare so pinch me, I'm dreamin'
I'm killin' off my demons 'cause my soul's worth redeemin'

[Break]
Ah, ah (Yeah, yeah)
Ah, ah, ah (As I toke my cigarettes, which I don't even smoke)
La, la (Walkin' on this dirty-ass road)
Ah, ah, ah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Clear a path as I keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten

[Verse]
Walkin' with my back against the sun
I been runnin' all my life, that's way before my life begun
Since my birth and seconds on Earth, I been the first one to confront
All of these cycles that get recycled, makin' it stifle while I stunt
Roll me a blunt so I forget it
But it make the details look so vivid (So vivid)
Went through a lot of shit in the last year (Uh-huh)
Then I said, "Fuck it, I'ma handle my business" (Yeah, yeah)
I been 180 to talk to one lady
She been regulatin' on how I feel (Feel)
Describe it as raw and real (Real)
I'm dealin' with all the ills
I'm tearin' up like I'm on Dr. Phil (Cry)
Ain't no use, you gotta walk (Walk)
Ain't no use, you gotta walk (Walk)
Who the fuck said, "Stop the track," bruh? Let a real nigga talk (Yeah)
I walk from the bitches, I walk from the friendship
I walk from some digits, 'cause lately, my nigga, I'm feelin' indifferent (Uh)
I wish y'all the best, and believe that, I meant it (Huh?)
Sentence, run-on sentence (Sentence)
Pray to God for repentance (For repentance)
Beat the odds at all costs so I won't share it with my infant (My infant)
Way before he start crawlin' (Crawlin')
Wash my sins, keep ballin' (Ballin')
I just gotta stay focused (Focused)
I just gotta keep walkin'
[Chorus]
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
Keep on walkin', ain't no stoppin'
In this dirty, filthy, rotten, nasty little world we call our home
They get blickies poppin', ain't no options for my partners
So they resort to scams and robbin'
Take away stress, we ganja coppin'
Blow it all out, it's all forgotten
