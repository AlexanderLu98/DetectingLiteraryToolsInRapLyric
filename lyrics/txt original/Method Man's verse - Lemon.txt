1 ContributorFNTG: From Niggas To Gods LyricsPRE-HOOK:

Blinded of myself
King James sit on the shelf
Looking inside myself
I connected with all my help

VERSE 1:

From the churches to the liquor stores, welcome signs on the doors
We speak in sin, cause it's hard hearing from the Lord
They say the mouth a sword, but the doctors cut I can't afford
It's hard to focus praying to the Lord for a Ford.?
When the pastors in the Lamborghini
He eating his fettuccine,I eat this two piece like a damn bikini
You eating greedy if you taking plates from the needy
You need your tithes but I'm tired of being trick or treated
I need a drink on a Sunday, after pastor preaching
I see the reason why they catching sermons from the TV
Double click,Delete Me
Hashtag Retweet Me
Now urine in the web
Like Peter Parker pissing his pee pee
Mary Poppins, popping Molly
Just to sleep with Yeezy
Niggas trap or die, to live trying to be a Jeezy
Face Tatted like Weezy
Just sicker than Eazy
But all my niggas is Gods I don't need you to teach me

From niggas to Godz x3
But all my niggas is Godz

VERSE 2:

Just graduated, and they ain't teach me my mathematics
They throw my patna P.O's
Like it's some kinda package
I need some answers
Can't even find them on college campus
Living wit my moms, but my loans
Damn near cost a mansion
Cause college cost about 100 grand
So I'm popping rubberbands
For my higher learning, need a Method Man
Or bust a rhyme, commit a crime
For the dollar signs
See it's designed to keep the color
Walking in the blind
I mean shit I got scratched off of the dean list
For taking mean sips, of Corona mixed with lemon lime
Double click, delete me
Hashtag retweet me
I'm snapping shots, why these
Niggas trying to  I&G me
Mary Poppins, popping Molly
Just to sleep w/ Yeezy
Niggas trap or die, to live trying to be a Jeezy
Face Tatted like Weezy
Just sicker than Eazy
But all my niggas is Gods I don't need you to teach me

Bridge
Joining Garveyism, I made the promise without the Chrism
Riding through the valley of death
I fear myself get them

Hut 1, Hut 2 you still lost in the youth X4Embed
