6 ContributorsPatience (Achievement rmx) Lyrics(Intro)
Yeah, take mothafuckin' three
This the third time I've did this shit, lets do it
Uh-huh, lawd
Hah, knowledge, bitch
Uh-Huh x2
Lawd, alright, look
Huh

(Verse 1: K.A.A.N.)
Said I been talking to myself and conversating with my shadow
A weeping willow a nooses, while niggas hanging a gallows
They gazing, I'm gallivanting my mind delusions of grandeur
While gratifying it's populous, pop a pill till I'm posthumous
Pardon all the particulars passing by opportunities
Proving that you're a novice proprietor of that usury
And I fashion myself in the form of the founding fathers
That found themselves in the passenger seat and then turn to martyrs
Maniacal as a masochist, masterminding this savageness
Ravaging with a purpose, impractical it was passion
Pretend a porous the poets propose a possible policy Promising people power provides a sense of security
Currently I am lacking that bet you thought I was done
And I rape and pillage the beats to procedure till it Atila the Hun
My words are weighing a ton
So they food for the feeble minded
You find yourself in a fetal position when I am rhyming
Ahhh, give it the quickest of pace, I'm willing to pay
My nigga you never relate, and I was supplying a taste
But you couldn't wait, the flow is like right in your face
The way that I spit it will leave you disgraced
They feeling me nigga for days, I know you amazed
I murder opponents and everything that I do is the dopest
I am so focused, giving a lyrical potion
We give a fuck if you notice, I am devoted
Feel like you already know this, giving my all with the music
Cause, when it's perception that means it is an illusion
Believing these lackadaisical lyrics, they lay solicitously
Convictions I been spitting I give them but more efficiently
In my honest opinion these people don't really listen
My penmanship is the precipest, the ink is made of excellence
Spit a spiritual verse like the words that come out of exodus
Exiting to a casket to excavate the omnipotent
The difference is that my intentions were never ignorant
The future's looking dim for the youth
And I give them truth, I'm 24 with no progression in this life that I lead
Anxieties of all my daily dilemmas delude my happiness
Direct me towards the rest of my vices, I'm feeling down again
A blunt, a bag of weed and some pac for sorrows I'm drowning in
My life vest is the pen and the pad and they keeping me afloat
I praise the holy ghost, but I know I'm going to hell
I excel at being a sinner for the simple fact that I'm insane
I saw my pastor asking is Jehovah even home today
To sanctify my soul, I'm the only one he forgot to save
I'm in a constant state of agony, fatigued mentally
A piece of wounded flesh, a bloody razor-blade and empathy
Is anyone able to see the beauty in an early death?
With a fast-rap as I backtrack to another line about society
But never lie to me, my nigga I can see it, read between the lines of all I've ever seen
And if we ever meet, then I'ma hit the beat until it barely breaths and you have never seen
You might also likeSomebody murder it all, I pray that you won't get involved
I leave'm appalled , the way that I always evolve
My nigga you thought, I said that I'm worried, I'm not
I'm giving you literal terms, but homie i'm never concerned
Whatever you earn, I pray that it helps
Just know that I'm doing this shit for myself, Lawd
My situation of destitution is temporary
Very necessary to turn the average legendary
Mr. Corleone in your home consult with consiglieres
The topic it varies depending on problems we discuss
I'm staring in the mirror at a sight thats hard to see
But there are people in this world that have it way worser than me
I'm a merciless self-pity, 'bout issues I can't control
I got a list of complaints to some people that I can blame
Ashamed that i'm not a man and the person I really am
Is someone that you couldn't stand, i take everything for granted
And this an honest depiction of myself, I'm being blatant
Realized a long time ago, it's all about your patience
Mothafucka

[Skit/Outro]
[Reporter]: Hey let me ask you something. Do you worry about achievement? Does it worry you or do you just do your own thing and say "here it is you either accept it or not"?
[Tom Waits]: Well, do I worry about achievement? No I worry about a lot of things but I don't worry about achievement
[Reporter]: No, well I'll scratch achievement off1Embed
