11 ContributorsGold Leaf Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woman of steel, S embroidered on the lapel
Superhero with these expressions ejected from out the grill
Nah mean? Like muslimahs is on the deen
From sunup to sundown, I'm preying on your regime
It's a theme
In every storyline, I'm supreme
Got the royal bloodline in my two fallopians
Rhyme king
They say I'm thorough like them Philly boys
Hit the city, call Peedi, we'll make 'em go, "Ring"
See, they crack under that pressure I'm stacking up
With every passionate display of my vernacular
I'm like the Loch Ness
Make an appearance, get people obsessed
Then dip and leave, legend like an Acura
See, this orifice got my course rather meteoric
You can catch me with the Moors, holding court in my Diadoras
One note of my voice got them boys tryna flee the force
Like I'm Darth, these kinda bars leave y'all amygdala scorched
What's popping?

[Chorus]
Well, why not? 'Cause shawty fire, my God
And I ain't know they make 'em this fly, pilot
Whole team got the shine on beam, high watts
Turn the whole sheet into gold leaf, Midas
They'll survive, hold up, well, maybe
Just catch the vibe, roll up, we waiting
You might also like[Verse 2]
The last born from out the asphalt and city dust
Now my life look like it was cast from the cinemas
I'm teaching class for the mass rap illiterate
Each of my rivals gasp when they glance at my syllabus
I be spitting math plus a fraction of literature
F with both subjects so I guess I'm polygamous
Beauty and the beast, homie, please don't bring the beef
Babydoll when I'm peace, if I'm upset, then I'm hideous
These double Xs got me extra saucy
See, Red linking with that gold and green like Selassie
'Cause everybody jumping on my space age philosophy
My tapes got em hopping out the Matrix like Ferraris
Well, I'm the modern day Almoravid
And my involvement can civilize a savage in eighty bars
It's why there's a following in every quadrant
'Cause Roc is cooking something lovely in the cauldron

[Chorus]
Well, why not? 'Cause shawty fire, my God
And I ain't know they make 'em this fly, pilot
Whole team got the shine on beam, high watts
Turn the whole sheet into gold leaf, Midas
They'll survive, hold up, well, maybe
Just catch the vibe, roll up, we waiting
[Verse 3]
I am the living, breathing word of God
Like the Bhaghavad, derived from the Woodabe tribe, listen
All my earliest written texts
You can find 'em in the desert on a scroll of ancient papyri, Egyptian
My code different from the status quo
I got UFOs hidden in my genetic catacombs
Me and my associates run up on your pulpit spitting oceans
With liquid gold dripping from the mandibles
I'm a Starseed out the Far East, off the deep end
Like a beacon, lighting up your faves with my ink pen
Found the apex, secured my place like I'm cement
Got your base bent all out of shape, tetrahedron, Lord
These kinda gems, they can't afford
So they get counterfeit MCs to fill the mounting void
Came to break the chain with 24k in my anecdotes
Now I got the whole planet surveying from my vantage point
Bird's eye

[Chorus]
Well, why not? 'Cause shawty fire, my God
And I ain't know they make 'em this fly, pilot
Whole team got the shine on beam, high watts
Turn the whole sheet into gold leaf, Midas
They'll survive, hold up, well, maybe
Just catch the vibe, roll up, we waiting1Embed
