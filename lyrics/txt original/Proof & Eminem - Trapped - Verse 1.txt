1 ContributorA Saintâ€™s Sins LyricsHook - I'm on the come up, anything that ya'll do I one up, flow angelic but now its time to bring the demon out, but as the world turns I learned life is hell, we're living in a World no different from a cell, I said its hard being a saint inside a sinner's body, I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met, and this from a person who never believed in religion, but shit my life is so fucked up man I can't help but give in

Verse 1- Standing before my Father, with my angelic brothers, he asks "Are you ready for pain?", "Are you ready to suffer?", "I am your humble servant I do whatever required.", Next thing I know I'm 4 years old starting this fight for survival, he says "You will deny me, the Enemy will tempt you, your memory of me will fade, for Christ you'll get forgetful.", "You will feel out of place, but you will soon adapt, you'll feel ignored at first but forever my son I will be back." Now I got flaws and all I see is wrong, judged by my appearance what the hell is going on?!
Trapped in this place everybody called earth, what's my worth?, what's a father?, what's a mother?, its all I heard, I didn't know so I go with it, I need an education? How you gonna teach me if you don't know? I was making accusations, now I'm disruptive because they didn't know the answers, well excuse me for calling adults out on apparent antics, I was frantic, so what now?, At church people crying out to nothing I could see, whose G-O-D, enlighten me so I could be free, but I never saw it, then I was 18, fuck it, Satan's won, I follow the crowd, I'm doing drugs, I'm getting drunk, until its no longer enough, lifes rough, then fuck life, suicide was my only way to hide from these lies, then God opens my eyes
I took my life back from the world, solely by his words, and what he showed me, he said "Show them.", I said "How? These humans are too proud, the truths not allowed, the chaos is too loud", "Start with your friends and it'll spread just like the lies did." Well I'm all for it, gave the Lord all of my heart not just a small portion, but I told him proof, I'm going to need more, they don't understand, its about souls we live among a war

Verse 2- Normality's just a synonym for majority, I sit back and observe the absurd and react accordingly, weekend comes get drunk, smoke weed and have fun, hold up wait my problems are still there when I sober up uhm, ok I question it, that and everything else, humans infatuated with fame and excessive wealth, ok uh, So we destroy our bodies?, and only chasing money?, somethings wrong, this is not for me, there's gotta be more to my story. And they call women "bitches" and it's a competition, who can have the most sex and is content with all that recognition, sorry that doesn't deem fulfillment, at least for me, bro do your thing, I found eternal life with no pain mmm I'll be ok, so now I go to parties, and all I see is puppets, everybody is out of their minds and they don't even know why, they think it's all in fun, let's go a little deeper, they can't see what I see, HA I see a ton of demons, and so I tell my Father, I can't help them unless I'm like them I refuse to watch ignorance allow Satan to sacrifice them, they think it's all insane, to a human mind, that's true, all they know is what they see, allow my peers to see you
Blaow, doing my best with what you've given me, your a memory but I know I'll see you soon no more convincing me, they think perfection is the only key, another lie, The Way, The Truth, and The Life, is the only path to perfection, innocence and adolescence is what he robs them of through the years, "So give your time to God, and give your heart to faith, and have no friends because all of your friends are still obsessed with me, I got the drugs, the sex, the alcohol, the "fun." Well I told Lucifer I'm winning now, boy I'm not the one, and my loved ones are coming too, my brother and my kin, he always forgives a saint's sins
