No, wait
Woah, Kenny
Step aside
I'm going to show you how it's done
Hit it

[Verse]
Okay
My bitch bad like battle rappers that make albums
With no outcome, X the middleman, no Malcolm
Where's the Talcum? Powder, when I smack niggas
Palm itchin', Napalms, we bomb business
Battle the strategist, it's just a game of battleship
Nayvadious the futuristic version of an avid kid
Actavis, everybody lean on me
Got them bags full of goodies like I'm CeeLo Green
Who the fuck tryna mob out? I been on my job, no need to call out
Turn your crib into a game of Fallout
You put me in the water, bet I crawl out
Alligator swag, came through with the Navigator swag
(Indirection) Viewer discretion upon my beat selection
You came with aggression, now your neck gon' need protection
(Py-pyrotechnics) Watch 'em come with the water hose
Make it rain on the bitch, that's how you water hoes
Make it rain with the clip for those that all oppose
Put they face in the box inside a centerfold
Fire flows like I'm red and white Mario
Zeltron out the barrio, cold as Ontario
These niggas hysterical, I'm historical
I am the oracle, I been know what's in store for you
You might also like[Outro]
No, wait
I told you, that you can't fuck with this
(Py-pyrotechnics)
This is God-level shit8Embed
