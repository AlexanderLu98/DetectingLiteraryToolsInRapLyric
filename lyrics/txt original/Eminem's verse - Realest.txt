8 ContributorsSteak Bake Lyrics[Intro]
Felt like I should bring back that grime element
Brudda, you beat up TweetsByBetty
You cried when you had a gun put to your head
What you gotta say about that?
Huh?
Fake Blue Borough yout
Check it

[Verse 1]
Beat up his girl, feds found out, nicked him
Living in Kent tryna hide from the dons
'cause your mumzy's stuck in the slum in Sydenham
That's the equivalent of someone hiding in New Cross
But they grew up in Hitchin
What's wrong with your block?
What's wrong with your ends?
Fam, you should rep that shit 'cause you lived it
I'm from the S West 9, it's a privilege
He's hiding in another borough and ends that he's not from
Oh yeah, you need to back him
Real G's will jack him
Came to the studio with Blacks after he got filthy with Jasmine
The boy takes cock, you've been sipping his drink
That's a violation, but will P attack him?
While you was rapping
Blacks was mooning and spooning a man
You couldn't see the pattern
You might also like[Verse 2]
Who's really real? I can see shit well
Name's P Money, got all of this cash
But sent none to help Little Dee in jail
No canteen for a week, gets peak
You left man to rot with police in cells
And that's your boy, you've been touring the globe
But dropped him out most when he needed help
So fuck your banquet
How you got man in a jail
Eating that bread and cheese that smells?
Trapped in a box, while your boys on a job
Getting paid for their mind, that's the realest hell
Course he touched road, felt some type of way
And you did a freestyle to redeem yourself
Ain't real to your boys, ain't real to the fans
And claimed you're an OG, shit smells
Lied so much you believe your tales

[Verse 3]
Never been G checked - darg, he's lying
You beg ends and you begged crews too
You even said you're Shower, you can't deny it
Sanjay, Faker
Baker and Ridi had you scared in your boots like a charging riot
(Who's Shower now?)
Weren't singing that when he saw Sanjay
In a car parked right by him
When Ridi jumped out the whip
To put you in your place in the blue, you started crying
Went to a house party, screaming "it's on" to Littles and Boxer
It's a par, be quiet
You got G checked by the Antis and broke down
Like you got told that your marge is dying
If you're so bad, why didn't you bad man up then?
Swear you said you're blasting iron?
Wiping the tears from your eyes when they left, bare stress
Got Tickles in the car just silent
You're the guy that picks on guys that are smaller than you
Brudda not me, my heart's a giant
I take the fact that you rushed me as a man
You cried before they got dark and violent
You didn't tell none of the mandem you shed tears
Switched up the story like "rah, he tried it"
Saw Sanjay and he got shook
Life machines couldn't have picked up his heartbeat mileage
[Verse 4]
I speak the truth, no riddles
Don't believe me? Ask Tickles
Made out you were on a badman ting but
Sanjay knows it's civil
Swore you were only on music when you saw Slaughter
Baby boy, cut the dribble
Man said something bout Vybz Kartel
But your boy's a chi chi and you're a ginnals
Blacks said he'll lick man down from every angle
But I don't think he means like shizzle
Said you're a roadman?
Okay, say that to Slaughter, if not humble pie nibble
Tell that guy that co-signed you
That he can get corn if he try jump in the middle
Came to the clash feeling like Incredible Hulk
But left in a wheelchair cripple
Oi, Paris (Shut up)
You wifey'd a hoe called Lils (Shut up)
You wifey'd a hoe called Sian (Shut up)
Didn't send money to Littles (Shut up)
Really had Paris all crying (Shut up)
Betty got beat up still (Shut up)
Ainsley put a gun to your head in Lewisham
You pleaded please don't kill (Shut up)
[Verse 5]
He had a strap put to his head and started to beg
And plead for his life, ask Ainsley
Big ting, no safety
Now I know what Frisco means when he says
"Them man are shaky"
Pissed your pants on the main roads
Scared for your life with no place to run for your safety
Where was your mandem then
When he had a gun aimed in the direction of your face, P?
Can't say I'm a snake
You think I forgot when mandem tried to start having up Pro?
Blacks went into his crib and robbed him with Roska
And a few dons that you might know
Pro was in OGz before you
You snaked the real team and tried to damage our flow
Then you snaked Roska and left him in a cell to rot
Fuck the act, you advertise loads

[Verse 6]
I got put on remand for protecting myself and my girl
I'm Samurai Joe
P rushed Chip in West End with a few mandem
But I don't think that he might know
I remixed the Eminem verse on Scary Movie One
Bigged you up, have a nice quote
Look me in the face and say
You think P Money is a challenge for me, I reply "I don't"
Why don't you ever fight one up?
Is it 'cause doctors will end up calling your mum up?
Went quiet for a few days and the fans thought that I was done
I got heat for the summer
Said you weren't hating on me
But your EP and your intentions show you're a sucker
If you're gonna war with me come with the facts
Or come with the straps and keep it one hunna (Bodies)
Span man around a caught me a (Body)
I don't mean dancing, jumped in a clash
And I sparked him and executed a (Body)
Blacks, stop looking at mandem's (Body)
I'll send a shot right into your (Body)
Blacks you're a slave to P like Dobby
Don't get gobby 'cause I'll just catch me a (Body)

[Verse 7]
(Steak bake)
This one's for Mela 'cause we say (Steak bake)
P Money lied so many times (Steak bake)
Said you want beef but you just wanna (Steak bake)
So let me explain the meaning of (Steak bake)
If a man lies on a dub? (Steak bake)
Man in your crew fuck bum? (Steak bake)
If it's too much for you, then say (Steaky)
Thought you'd won, but lost (Steaky)
Now we all know that you're soft (Steaky)
All your fans doubted Dot (Steaky)
Really, they lost the plot (Steaky)
Blacks is gay, that's a lot (Steaky)
Your brother's been taking the cock (Steaky)
P Money looking all lost (Steaky)
Termz kick him out, show him who's boss (Steaky)

[Outro]
Nah
(Techy)
Dubplate ended but still it's (Techy)
Can't deny the facts fam, it's (Techy)
Bodied you acapella, that's (Techy)
Dot killed P with a flow that's (Techy)2Embed
