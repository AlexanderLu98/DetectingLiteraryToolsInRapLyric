1 ContributorMy Shine LyricsRamping up my lines so you know that I'm inclined to
Influenza you what can I say they're pretty sick dude it's so sick
That I vomitted on this track like the fat chap yacked during laps after practice

Not a game but if it was I'd be a head and it'd be in the bag like Slevin
Blow your mind like Pitt did Kevin after 7 hope you get my reference, otherwise it's dull and pointless
My raps always have a point, being a blunt kid and I'm insane I just want a shot like Kobain not plain n round like a wafer, opposite of tame
My profane shit is the propane to a flame 'bout to blow up somebody better restrain Belligerent Dave

Radio:
This is Sway, Sway, Sway, Sway in the morning

Terrence Howard on the Radio:
It's life or death so I wanna make you forget your lines because you're so caught up in what I'm doing, not so that you won't be able to deliver your lines, that your lines become obsolete, and you tell the story from your spirit that's what I think we are supposed to do

Verse 2:
Sorry if it's over your head my meaning's in the deep end
That's just my M.O. like I skipped a letter it won't N
Hope to one day bring change to the game with my two cents, like Catniss did because she was Ru-less
But my crowd is booless like Monster's University and recently I'm the monster, in the university
Because I'm taking my path very differently checking all the doors just like Mike Wizowski
Stop me you won't, I'm a dog respect is the bone I'm trying to own the game these other clones just want a loan
They're just kids who haven't grown I'll be the chaperone and won't be overthrown like a pass 'cuz my future's on the throne

Kevin Hart on the Radio:
You're giving a great service here man. Im here right now because I need you and your voice to help put out my content and my product!

ADHD? Just letters to me, some letters that were not diagnosed to me from an M.D
That's malpractice all I see are god damn distractions but what if rap is actually my passion? (passion)
It's not paradox on the track like double therapy a chronic alcoholic and these bars are the remedy
I spend so much time with them I figure I got heart, finally got on the mike the hardest part is to start
Wanna be the kid who blows your mind with rhymes, makes you hit rewind before I'm even signed
With meaning that's so ingeniously intertwined like physics, know that I got power cuz my work is over time
Make shit that will make the blind see like it's divine and hear the haters call blasphemy it's fine
Cuz know I don't give a shit like I'm pissed, shipwreck in my head so I jump quick to music

Tyler the Creator on the Radio:
I focused in and tried to craft hte worst shit I could possibly make. The album fucking sucks
Sway: That sounds fucking fabulous!

Verse 4:
2010 Nasdaq I'm back with a few more bars
I'm just doing me living my life unlike avatar trying to be the best so I'm shooting for the stars
Eat the shitty competition for breakfast, shart on my pop tart
Nas in my go kart
Smart sharp guy heterosexual A's on my report card
But I don't care just want out the dark, and won't stop till I'm on top
Of the charts

Kanye on the Radio:
I am warhol.  I am the number 1 most impactful artist of our generation
