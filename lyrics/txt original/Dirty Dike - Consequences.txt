8 ContributorsConsequences Lyrics[Verse 1: Dirty Dike]
I was scared of release, every sin barely redeemed
It never seemed fair I just stare and perceive
And you expected me to care and believe
From a chair when you speak you don't care when I leave (fuck off)
Now how the fuck can I prepare to be free
When my hair's clean shaved and I'm there on the street
(Like, are you staring at me ?) I've forgotten what a tramp is
Mad shit was lost in the bottom of my sandpit
That pissed me off it's pot luck and not the world's end
Fourteen months to get dumped by your girlfriend
I turned chauvinistic, went ballistic
But never showed a bit of it and learned where I did fit
It's business, life took a piss where my wish list
Slid through my fingertips and ripped into thin strips
I've been spitting since prison so I sip crisp
And dismiss these visions 'till my wig splits

[Hook: Dirty Dike]
It's just a consequence of what I do
Man I'm a rapper slash criminal, what are you?
Do you work a 9 to 5 in a flock of truths
Or are you walking down the line of forgotten youths?

It's just a consequence of what I do
Man I'm a rapper slash criminal, what are you?
Do you work a 9 to 5 in a flock of truths
Or are you walking down the thin line of forgotten youths?

I'm sorry that I broke the law
But you were smoking draw way before I clock the open door
You know the score, I was lonely, broke and poor
Terrified of getting mesmerised by my sober thoughts
So, it's back to drinking again
With a qualified skill of how to think with a pen
The brink of my head dissembled with a kink and a bend
The lingering stench of death as I'm sniffing again
This prison a blend and shimmered with a glistening red
Wish I read instead of flicking through the pictures again
And yes I guess stress does care when you're leaving
Screaming, scratching at the ceiling
Never had a reason, clever and attach it from the meaning
Staring 'round the cell that you're attacking your beliefs in
I'm packing what I need, and these are not adventures
I'm acting how I please, cause I've seen the consequences

[Hook: Dirty Dike]
It's just a consequence of what I do
Man I'm a rapper slash criminal, what are you?
Do you work a 9 to 5 in a flock of truths
Or are you walking down the line of forgotten youths?

It's just a consequence of what I do
Man I'm a rapper slash criminal, what are you?
Do you work a 9 to 5 in a flock of truths
Or are you walking down the thin line of forgotten youths?
[Outro]
"Young men with a mind for revenge need little encouragement...You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose."
(consequence, consequence)
"I hope you understand"
(consequence, consequence)
"Truth or consequences, life or death sentence"
"Embrace faith with open arms"
(consequence, consequence)
"Fuckface!...
...Do you expect me to be, thick in the head, the way you want me?...
...Do what we tell you, think what we tell you, say what we tell you, squawk, be a fucking parrot!...
...I hate you for putting me in here...
...You put yourself in here."
"Everyone trying to be trife, never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offences"1Embed
