Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend
Daily pilgrimage wake up in Brooklyn like Gilgamesh
Torn between a few options like a polygamist
So militant, my outlook is ill-advised
I make it sound memorable, like the day Attila diеd
Take a stroll down Nostra hit the gym like
Gеt my muscle memory going like when my pen strikes
Super sesh shoulders and quadriceps bubblin'
For sex I'm a glutton that shorty got my neck bucklin'
Beef patty, fuck a protein shake
Elohim triple beam style low-key great
Peep style walk the pavement on streets I don't own
Feeling like the god of the world in my own zone
You ain't put it down to work if that freak don't moan
She made me bust twice now my whole libido gone
Crossing the bridge now studio flow Midtown
Sit down the engineers late got me pissed now
I got to skate back the cake I got to get back
So laid back the victory's near and I can taste that
Hit the hilal spot feeling like Malcolm I'm a now rock
Pulling out notes out my pocket like Bilal got
Rock shows like clock work to me its just a foul shot
Keep my business poppin' off like that Canal spot
For my position nothing new that I fought
Hustle 101 see mind state is New York

Westside, eastside, south side and north
Better be careful yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Why don't you tell me yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Better be careful yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Best be careful which side is yours

Verse 2: Nieve
Yeah
They ask me how me how I'm livin I say a mile a minute
I ain't gonna give up till I can get you to stop and listen
This is my only mission I'm not concerned with danger
How could I be when I'm from the city of fallen angels
Notice the marijuana let it come breath amongst us
Gives me the freedom to make the music to the reach the youngstas
I got that cold hard soul, my rap be
A reflection of my city that be mirrored exactly
(uh), swords and rusty daggers coming from some attackers
This ain't a movie this from the school that I used to hang at
Never the perfect student now I'm the perfect teacher
How do you do, the name's Nieve, nice to meet ya
You can catch me out on Venice beach
Acting all hysterically pouring out my Hennessy
(yeah) I still do this for the legacy
Of 2pac and Biggie we carry on in your memory
Chorus: Nieve
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Better be careful yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Why don't you tell me yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Better be careful yo which side is yours
Westside, eastside, south side and north
Best be careful which side is yours

Scratches
Competition because I have a greater mission
