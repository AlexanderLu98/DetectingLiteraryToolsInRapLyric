African estate grass and grapes, masculine the slave, master hate
Exactly when they emasculate, congratulate gay, amass the hate
As the black lady ass shake, they fascinated, they masturbate
The black parade straight exacerbates
The actual hate they imaginate
That's when they racist asses straight harass us as they evacuate
Imagine wearin' they mask somewhere, can't imagine makin' it past the day
Hell is hated, Heaven's a elevated melanated masquerade
We celebrate, they'll vaccinate, you separate, they assassinate
Weapons mastered, yes, they active, yes, they matter, Maj Toure (Toure)
Rep they blackness, leather jackets, black beret (Beret)
Pastor Mase, Ice Cube, Jam Master Jay
Trunks of jewelry, come through and truly
Trump security, Grand Master Jay
Gucci conned me out of Luciano, to Armani, I'm a moulinyano
Drove her out to hit the Neimans in Cabo
Scope the model, made her Venus De Milo
Spend a lot at the Palazzo
Send you hollow semi-autos, powder blue Diablo
Probably pop a cop or two to honor Breonna and Amadou Diallo
They trackin' the African breed to patent the seeds
They snatchin' the apple from Adam and Eve to patent the seeds
Attack chemically, then patent disease
I rep murder, violence, methane bars, jet stream God (Jet stream God)
You rep Turtle Island, just ain't y'alls, Epstein's log (Epstein's log)
And that's king talk, my queen shopping in LA (LA)
See me out in that green drop, that thing not a Chevy (Chevy)
Beam on top of that slingshot, Glock sing soft as Dwele (Dwele)
And things start to fall apart like Chinua Achebe (Achebe)
