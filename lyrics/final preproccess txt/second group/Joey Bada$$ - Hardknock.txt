Niggas wanna know
What I’m about; I’m 'bout blowin' loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars like a con position?
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike, they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate, I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you, I keep my attitude on "screw it, a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo' chick keep messagin' me, "Who the bestest MC?" They be mentionin' me
Too hot, I be molestin' the beat
Fuck math, teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first-class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teachin' for some regents, I'm flyin' over regions
Reachin' all-time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked, watchin' out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice, you still a nemesis
Smokin' on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linkin' terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play, they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slingin' some regs, poppin' some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be backstage grippin' haze, breakin' my leg
My folks was makin' the best when they was naked in bed, motherfucker
