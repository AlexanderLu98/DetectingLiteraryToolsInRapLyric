New Jersey legend present, you dirty peasants
Two 37s make you jump or duck like it's burpee lessons
You heard he steppin'? Oh, he must be off two Percies, sweatin'
Get 'em close to God with one touch and such, not a pervy reverend
Fuck! Pull your card just to earn the credit
I'll push your buttons just to whoop your ass, I'm learning Tekken
Sturdy weapon, need to alert the feds when you see him lurking sections
How many hearses here? Eleven, and it ain't even been thirty seconds!
Ha! Uh, yes, I prefer ascension
I been it, fuck a tag, I'm not concerned with mentions
I told my mommy "I'm sorry, I can't do burger flippin'"
If I don't do this, this the Dead Sea Scrolls; verses hidden
Slave trade for my great-great-great-great-great granddaddy
Smashed his master's daughter, got banned up North, and I'm so happy
Could use your energy to float, but you just flow at me
The only way that you the GOAT is if you go at me
