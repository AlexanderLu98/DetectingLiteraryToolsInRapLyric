I got Caviar by the boat load
Fellatio by the throat load
I'm livin' the shit that you dreaming about
And I won't go back to the old school
These ojos seen old hoes
They gold news, my rollie got a rollie
I'm double timing these old dudes
Ride around with a bad broad
Fast car with the top back
Fast lane, like Nascar
Champagne, I pop that
Bought a black car, with a black card
Don't act hard, you not that
Got a Jaguar for the side chick
Now she give me that bobcat
All that and a bag of Lays
Hit the sheets with a freak I bag and lay
They cop feelins' like PD
I cop a feel like David Blaine, it's magic, no hat-trick
I mask emotion, like masquerade on an escapade up in the Escalade
When I drop this track, I'ma escalate
