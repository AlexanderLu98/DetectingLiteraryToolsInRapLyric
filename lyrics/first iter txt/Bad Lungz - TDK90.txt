This that TDK90, Shallah flow
Purple tape ultra violet cosmos
Getting Chavo, from Cuba to Cabo off the dial tone
I'm more Puerta Plata Papo, Gaudy Guapo Capo
The D’s still on us like vitiligo, ya spot's blown
Hot stove, throw the ice in and watch it dance like Iris Chacon
Stir fry, let it air dry, mix the butter with the lactose that's my Sazon
My plug still sipping whiskey still listening to la cucaracha
Out of a food truck selling zaza and chimichangas
Ay caramba! I shake the block up, if my waka go blakka blakka
Can’t stop, I love the hustle like I'm two step'n at the casablanca
My bitch thick mortician viscous, she drop dead gorgeous
Pussy tighter than parallel parking, on a one way in Weekhawken
Can't condеmn or condone I'm never crеdulous
Cause you can try hide lies and twist the truth with rhetoric
But the god is prevalent
Illest cat that rap on the map whether bap or trap
My styles ain't free
Touching green like an arborist, cutting a granny smith with a tourmaline sparkling
You in the wrong plaza, thinking you can open shop up
Custodian you'll get mopped up, if I pop up at ya pop up
You niggas is my Hijos, since y'all the GOAT I’m cooking chivo
I know he got the paper, you just gotta crack ’em to get it
I made a fortune off the cookie, kept the gas unleaded
