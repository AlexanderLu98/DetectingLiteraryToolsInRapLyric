Avid reader, learnin' through pages I've kept in Trapper Keepers
Master thinkers, studyin' paintings hanging in galleria
Strapped Adidas Japanese sneakers, I'm flying past Korea
Stamp the Visa, turnin' down women who look like Catherine Zeta
Passive drinker, premium diva vodka and black tequila
Packed arenas, while you put niggas to sleep like anesthesia
Wack demeanor, ghost to the industry, it's the rap Tsushima
That's Katrina, floodin ’the net, somebody grab Serena
Back and forth, what’s all the racket for, I captured ether
Stripes earned like the fastest cheetah tryin' to catch a zebra
Alopecia, you missing here on the list of classic features
Cats is weaker, puttin’ out sleepers, couldn't out-wrap a pita
Factz the reaper, verses eternal, that's word to Angelina
At my leisure, I was a prince datin' a ballerina
Had an eager followin’, that procedure was actually deeper
Whiz kid, don't gotta ask Khalifa, this track's a heater
