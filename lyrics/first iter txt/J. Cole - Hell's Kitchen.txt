Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got platinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks
