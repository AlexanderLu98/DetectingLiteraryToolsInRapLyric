Foot on the gas come try and keep up
Turbo on the engine, I'd crash before I ease up
I push 222 on the dash, might break the meter
Might just smack the fucking shit out these rappers, go pick ya teeth up
Know the procedure, stay in ya lane don't try and speak up
Pull out in Bimmers, untucked the chain now watch 'em freeze up
I pour up the Ace of Spades in the vintage Versace teacup
In that black on black popping up on 'em like "meet the reaper" ah
Killer Kurt stepped in, now the hoes all going bat shit
I'm on they ass again, they still recouping from my last shit
These niggas' energies don't match the ones that's in they captions
I might just hit a stain then blow his stimmy on some Raf shit
Niggas lacking class, all my linens came from Sak's Fifth
Tuscan Leather fragrance, Tom Ford also the glasses
The young handsome devil, sex symbol, left shawty gasping
You only played yourself by tryna play me like I'm average
So please fall back no this ain't what you want
The smoke complimentary nigga, no this ain't what you thought
Rick Owens all of my tags, shit I don't mean to flaunt
I break shawty's back then blow bands before the break of dawn
A hundred stylists couldn't get you styled like this
Niggas'll break they jaw they try and bite a style like this
These clowns my kids, they couldn't walk a mile in my kicks
They'd probably rather kill theyself than see a smile on the kid, well shit
All my life I want money and power
Count these bands faster than hands count hours
Dousing the crowd in champagne the hoes just shout louder
Royalty in the flesh, they showering me in flowers
Coward niggas, can't see 'em through the tint on the lens
Plus I'm a one of one I've never been too big on the trends
Told me she only fuck with niggas that got money to spend
That's when I went and bent her over on the hood of the Benz
