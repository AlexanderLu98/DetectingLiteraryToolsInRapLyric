I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing
