The bank's a G, all C.R.E.A.M down's a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme, or some counterfeit C.R.E.A.M
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got they game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now, watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short-fused
