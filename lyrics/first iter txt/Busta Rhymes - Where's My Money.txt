Wait a minute, came to go get it, ranger fitted
Whenever it come to paper, better know I'm major with it
Make it rain a major blizzard, leather alligator lizard
I Talledega race any challenger; name a digit!
Even if on the slightest, you take a smidget
Or dare touch my revenue, I'll slice you with the razor, quit it!
Icy till I make it frigid, burr
The laws of physics says it's getting cold
My money taller than a hall of midgets
I get up all up in it, kicking down the door, who is it?
Bitch, I be the crew of bill collectors, pay them all a visit
After cleaning bank accounts you questioned
If I gave a shit, if not I tell the truth
So you could tell 'em that the player did it
It's OK, I say a prayer, it's the mayor bitch slayer
Giving you another layer of the data trick
