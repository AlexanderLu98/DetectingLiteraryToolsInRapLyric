Thought I couldn't do better with the cash flow, but again, I did it
Want me to go with the fast flow, 'cause it's been a minute
But with the pen, no limit, every single minute, there's a sin committed
I'm buildin' my path, so they are really livid
But I see you winnin' and Iʼm glad, Toke'
Hats off, chapeau, mad glow, that shows
You can still be lyrical and get it and make mad dough, pack shows
Thatʼs dope, only the beginning and we past most
I saw the "Hi Billie" and the "Hi Cole", then
I said fuck it, wanted to say "Hi Token"
I go in, Iʼm hopin'
That weʼre definitely getting closer to the day that I will win
'Cause Iʼm getting hungry as fuck and they donʼt see me
I'll go to battle with anyone, this is war season
I feel like Eminem killing Machine Gun after the song with Tech:
Bitch, I will diss you for no reason
God on speed dial
Devil on— wait, let me kill another beat now

Been on top of my city, but now they tryna play
Still no recognition, bitches not givin' me the time of day
But next time you see me, put your hands together and bow to me
'Cause I came in the game and I'ma stay
Kinda fake, yʼall are snakes, wondering 'bout my final fate
Will be invisible livin' contender, kill syllables every night on stage?
Yeah, they donʼt support me but the day they'll see me pop
They'll be like "It's Versvs, I grew up with the guy!" Okay
Damn, man, this shit's insanity, becomin' just who I planned to be
Thank you if you're a fan of me, turned a dream to reality
Did it all by myself, don't expect you to give a hand to me
Speak four languages and bitches keep misunderstandin' me
Damn, but I'm gettin' comfortable, comin' through
She said that I only wanna smash, it is nothin' new
'Cause when overthinking's the only thing you fuckin' do
Then fuckin' becomes the only thing you really want to do
How many people stole my flow, bitch? I can roll on any opponents
Sendin' my condolences, I lose control at any moment
I was broken, I think you noticed, I was frozen, now I'm growin'
I could go on tour, coast to coast, kill a show with Token
They wanna make me a household name
But I still call my mother every mornin', every single day
They wanna make me a household name
But the drugs and the fame, I ain't about those things
Switch it up

I'm a one-stop shop for the energy
Pop, I will never be
This is hip-hop, call cops, it's a felony
Matter of fact— shots, shots, shots; documentary
Never stop, never drop flops, I'll forever be
Makin' guap, at the top top, fuck the enemies
They cannot chop nonstop, so I let 'em be
Why compete with anyone who's never been ahead of me?
Just wanted to show you I can do this flow too
Token, you've been a motivation, this shit is so true
Fifteen, was tellin' the page what I go through
Only wrote because I needed to, not 'cause I chose to have ambition
Rap persistent, crash the business
Pad and pencil, that's the mission
Feel like when I rap and I spaz on this bitch
I answer Dre's question, thatʼs the difference
Let's go!
