Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, "You put the Thought on? Yikes"
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport on mics
I'm from an era you had beef, y'all prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
All my dogs is out the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call, my youngins takin' flight
You a bark bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself, then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo Vespucci
I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmose the Third with seven inch herringbones
