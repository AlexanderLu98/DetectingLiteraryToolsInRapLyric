Yo it's the blind swordsman, the show's over
Decapitate and skin a snake, I make the waist match the cobra skinned loafers
Tote hold a piece, with two more in the Comme holster
Chrome choker, hoes get cold shoulders and get no closure
I hold control of universes, polar and solar
Chauffeur wave sticks like composers don't get no closer
Dominican she off the boat, her skin tone mocha
In the bubble bath, I count the dough while she rolе doja
Tell them niggas kiss the dust, bеst no discuss
Chrome leather, my fronts complement embellished studs
Pockets watchers P.S. my wallet weight eleven tons
A young James Bond with techs tucked in a Margiela tux
Fellas just, hit the road don't bother tryna settle in
Fore heat seeking bullets escort you off of the premises
Electric currents flowing through my veins and through my skeleton
I walk through portals, rendezvoused with oracles and revenants
Napalm the penmanship, Porsche like a Pegasus
I never seen a point to beef with niggas that I'm better than
Ya shawty got swept up off her feet via my etiquette
I let her cum first and she said "Kurt you're such a gentleman"
The world on my finger tips, like I knew balance
They try and challenge, and meet the end like a New Balance
The coupe just landed on the moon, the moon boots Alyx
You niggas sound like Clipse with no Push, too much malice
Too much chatting, niggas ain't making sense they needa stay in check
The razor send his head through the ceiling it's no escaping death
So take your best, might break his neck before a sweat
Then wake and focus on making what's in between the bacon egg
Tony stark in the flesh, a hole inside my chest
Comme Des logo the breast, and shit ya'll the rest
Niggas get up charged and dissed I'm done with making friends
Plus I could run circles round these niggas in a weighted vest
I plot moves, they swapped crews then my stock grew
The ops through, I booked his lunch money and copped shoes
I swear to God I hate these niggas more than Fox News
A bunch of fucking pussies running round dressed in costumes
A cosmic entity, I'm not them, plot sensibly
I pop deputies, and transcend gods genetically
They not threats to me, they couldn't fuck with five percent of me
I pulverize planets in my palm passive aggressively
So gone head and kiss the ring, hoe I'm head honcho
Reign of terror, I popped up in the Supreme poncho
Shooter got mini guns for hands he do you in pronto
Christian Dior ski mask, he look like Lil Fonto
Challenge me at your will, I won't hold back
Homie I'm not the one to play with tell your man's fall back
I backhand a rapper then hand him his tampon back
I'm the king of my city and nigga I stand on that motherfucker
