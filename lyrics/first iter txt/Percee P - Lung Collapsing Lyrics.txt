I'm the capital P-E-R-C-double E
Dash P-P dash double E-C-R-E-P in me
Shots in top lyrical fitness, that's why you bit this
Get this, I got a witness and I won't quit this
Or flip flop, get dropped, shit, I'm in tip-top shape
Lyrics escape, can't even catch 'em with tape
Main attraction, usin' my brain, a fraction
Of my knowledge of wisdom and lyrical rhythm'll give 'em
A migraine, before I reign on stage
You better walk like the fingers on a Yellow Page
Rhymes and homicides are lethal, nobody's equal to me
No one survived, so why make a sequel?
MC Percee P give no mercy to nobody MC'in till they reimburse me
I cold grip the mic, strike then rip his life
My raps dilapidate adversaries with Kryptonite
Hit you with a verse, make you disperse but first
Call up a hearse 'cause Perc' leave you worse than this
Brain cells shatter, MC's scatter
I splatter them all with somethin' that ain't even matter
Got a ladder on stage, women runnin', come in every age
But never ring on my finger, this thing'll linger un-engaged
Renegade, Percee P ain't afraid of no one
No gun or son, I'm gettin' paid when my record's played
Every weekend like lottery, rap's a part of me
Words flow but don't show no blood in you artery
Ladies greet me, treat me like the stars
When I show up
They start to throw up all their panties and bras at me
Rap is the last of me, now to gas women with my pencil
I send you into a mental catastrophe
This rhyme ain't designed for prime time
In a battle line for line, you're behind
Every mind tryin' to rhyme with intellect, spellin' all incorrect
Defy your every line, mine's an introspective
Those in the premises will always remember this
Record, elected your top ten, stop then and reminisce
Percee P, no rapper get worse than me
When it comes to rhymes, every verse will be
Harder than titanium, parts from your cranium
Burst, disperse, every verse explodes like uranium
So, yo, don't upset me, 'cause that will only get me
Mad enough, it's bad enough, I had enough of
Lettin' these amateurs rock, I call them wannabes
I bet they're all the P's
And if they ain't, they gonna be
To all y'all critics, just admit it
My style is dope, you can't cope and you hope to get it
You're captivated, activated, rap-related fans leave infatuated
When I get open, the place starts smokin'
You start chokin', showboat and Perc get broken
Rehearse a while, let it get versatile
I reverse your style, OK, B? Then maybe Perc'll smile
You're put in a stretcher
When I let the style get ya, I bet ya sweat the Rhyme Inspector
Records you manufacture are so wack you can't
Sing 'em or bring 'em, people fling 'em back at ya
You're the fattest, baddest, of the best copycatters
When they played it
It rated G for garbage 'cause that's your status
Nobody's iller, on the mic you never know
When I'mma strike 'em like the Zodiac Killer
This 22 year old veteran you ain't better than
Medicine won't help, slicks think we're peddlin'
When a writer's bite and hype the type, parasites swipe
You're bitin', you're stage fright, don't even hold the mic right
