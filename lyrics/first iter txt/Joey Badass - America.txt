'Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' Mach 6
Rise to the top and topics change
To Glocks and the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though
Still facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars, droppin' prison soap
Beggin' for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources, now he in the store
