Cole and Yachty, comin' for they respect, come and pay your debt
Just like a travel pillow, we at your neck for the way you slept
This nuance, but I see hella influence in the way you dress
The way you sound, the way you try to move, you try to stay abreast on all the latest flows and latest tones from Generation X
Y'all chasing relevance, it's evidenced by the way you step
As for me, I cook so masterfully, ain't gotta pay a chef
I'm older now, but still, I'm cuttin' edge, I'm like a bayonet
From out the 'Ville, we OSHA certified, you gotta wear your vest
Too many homicides, a lotta slidin', they good at makin' decks
Thanks to God, I made it out the city, most would say I'm blessed
My greatest flex is that I made a milli', feel like I'm Bangladesh
I hate the press, refusin' interviews whenever they request
Niggas fake-progressive and woke, I started sayin' less
I had to stop it, peeped how they profit off of racial stress
Some activists got so rich, they prolly wish we stay oppressed
Studio steppers movin' extra on songs, fakin' rep
Only breakin' bad in the lab, thought y'all was makin' meth
Niggas makin' threats and I laugh, that's 'cause you ain't a threat
Don't ask how I feel 'bout no rappers, shit, they okay, I guess
Incomin' call, press the button, the one that say accept
He FaceTime to ask for a feature and saw the face of death
I'm on your song, your streams goin' up, not quite the Drake effect
But don't complain, bitch, take what you get and cut the label check
My table set, I dine on your favorite, one verse'll take his breath
I prolly put more niggas on pause than Cam and Mason Beth
My agent get a whole lotta calls, it's like he paid the ref
These bitches out here lookin' like Steph on the late contest
Wide open, shootin' they shot, don't even waste your breath
I been stop fuckin' you thots, ain't got no patience left
Save that shit for one of them niggas that rock the fake Pateks
My paper stretched just like a Laker before he break a sweat
Signed, the greatest yet
