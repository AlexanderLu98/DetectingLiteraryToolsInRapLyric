DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, BOOM
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail, make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averagin' above average men
Rancid rants havin' ramblin' savages scavengin'
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flow ill, chrome stiff hat
Known for writin' lightnin' tight lines, chiefin', beefin'
Bein' off deep ends, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now, that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin', "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playin' with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he sayin' but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates
