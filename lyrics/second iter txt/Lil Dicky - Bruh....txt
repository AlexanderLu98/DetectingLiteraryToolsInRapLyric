This shit I'm making's always tight, it's like a yoga store
They all up in the other boat, it's why I'm overboard
I'm taking time to do it right, it's like a soda pour
Cause we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for
Damn, packing the band-wagon, the man cracking
The man  packing the stands, had them clapping they hands
Tagging they Grams, Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans, playing having the plan
Fans rapping the jams, sagging my pants
You see the type of shit I do on the track?
Hot shit, like I poop in the jacket
Won't mack your bitch, but yo, I'm bout to come and mack your clique
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio
They ball all retarded, Cuba Gooding up in radio
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable
I'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat
Aflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind, but I tuck this move
I made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew
These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew
I'm too nice, like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo twice
As in double as fuckable as he was and dude tries
To be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles
And ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him
And someone tell him, “Listen, you bugging
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble?” but he rebuttal with
"I think I just love her, so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice?"
