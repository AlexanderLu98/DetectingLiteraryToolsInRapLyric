One of the coolest to rep my sec
Only the foolish neglect projects
Coming from the newest and blessed by Tech
Clergy of cray's, worthy of praise
Like Anubis and Wepwawet
Dismiss what I play to thee
A Damu could muster wrong Suge
Slick spit from a hater see
All the crew stood of a strong wood
Mystics with the fate of T
Read I'll move hoods, bruh yo' song should
Critics what they say to me
Is that I'm too good for my own good
A lotta my people in circles 'round the hood
They treat my music like a blondie
Too much emotion and too many cadences
Thеy want you on the mic, a zombie
Lyrically against the ficklе listener
Quick to pistol-whip you like you're Chauncey
Then I step wit' a thickie like Ashanti
Spit a web of witty, quite Anansi
If you spit ridiculous and raise the bar up
They don't wanna reach it
And won't ever seek it
The moment I speak it
Don't wanna receive it
The one I'm alone at the top
You become so invisible to them
Your name don't spark up
Opponent I'll beat it, I'm only conceited
The dome it competed, the tone it retreated
They running, I'm gone and forgot
Rigorous fail when idols give it
Wicked as hell and pyro with it
Gibberish sells and I grow vicious
Nigga this Del in Hieroglyphics
Too good at a thing, you just might be shunned
I can't even do a Verzuz with none
'Cause I'm one of one
