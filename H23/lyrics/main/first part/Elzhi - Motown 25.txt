I end careers, years, pierce ears fierce with spears
They say I'm gifted, get lifted like the beers in Cheers
Catch a thunder bolt, pockets stay lumped from hundred notes
Stunning quotes make you run your coat while the sun's afloat
Prehaps, my skill is real as G Rap's, it feel as ill
As concealing drills in the knee caps
Your funny style get three snaps in the circle
When off the purple and greens
I'm higher than the jeans on Urkel, then I murk you
Bust TECs, the lead sparking, now who be my next head target?
I lift up, roll out like the red carpet
Say my name three times in the mirror and if I hear you
I'll appear clearer, extend both arms and pull you nearer
Pound for pound, I'm pretty live on the mic
And keep it flooded like Mike on Motown 25
Put your soul on ice and sold it for a whole known price
I'm nice, keep a knot swole on dice
Grin is sarcastic, the way my pen'll spark acid
On the bar, whether in the crib or the car, blast it
Son is a, prob' rob funds from your publisher
While his dogs put his guns to you like the Punisher
Or the Terminator, flow is harder than a German major
Midtermin' paper, the kid burns the saber
Striking cats, how you want it, gats, spike or bats?
I know you liking that, I stay sharper than Viking hats
Exhale, blowed mist, served you with a cold dish
Niggas vomiting, bowels moving, they can't hold piss
​​​eL and Royce, double team, hotter than a cup of steam
Club your spleen and bury you, just as deep as a submarine
Flawless, should be that very reason you applaud us
You saw us laying down a law just as raw as crawfish
You met your death, and although I took away your breath
And I ran, I still left with a grand like Theft Auto
