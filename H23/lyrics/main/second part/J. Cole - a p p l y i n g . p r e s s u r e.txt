Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind where crime festers
And nines showing like they in they second trimesters (Pregnant)
That’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online, I pay no mind to their benign gesturеs (Mm)
Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things, to say thе least
My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East (What up, East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas' whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to (I understand that)
Instead of cappin', why don’t you talk about being a broke rapper? (I don’t understand that)
That's a perspective I respect because it’s real
What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
That was me in '08, seein' no cake
Not even on dates I celebrated my birth
Just did the mental math and calculated my worth
Shit crazy, didn’t know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (I'm the real Shady)
Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo
Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe
'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles
Just projectiles from niggas salty, you rockin' the fresher textiles
I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)
Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)
I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch
But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich
Envy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you
If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you
Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)
But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell they soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)
Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)
