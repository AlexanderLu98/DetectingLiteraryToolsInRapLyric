Uh, uh-huh

[Verse]
Wind in my face, hound at my heels
At the end, I'm winning this race, only then can I chill
But 'til then, don't ever try to stagnate the magnate
When it's money on the line, never make the bag wait
I just add weight to the bag until the bag break
That holy swag make the cash get the gas face
In the first place
I got no motherfucking business coming in last place
My birthplace taught me not to stop
I'm more advanced than my classmates
I came into the game on a fast break
And I'm gang gang likе Billy Bathgate
The protagonist, and I narrate in thе same slang that Philly has
I can't stop, if I don't work then I won't eat
Time keeps running like a river, it don't cease
In the mind of a super nigga, it's no peace
Can't stop running like I'm ducking from police, stop
Cooley High, they tryna do me like Cochise
The flow so obese, it's springing a slow leak
I keep a crowd satisfied, bringing 'em cold heat
I'm gratified, winning, bling bling and no gold teeth
Yo, stop, you know them cameras is gon' see
My hammers ain't for brandishing if Canons is on me
Please, you ain't fucking with no amateurs, homie
Philly ain't known for cheesesteak sandwiches only, stop
Yo, I'm at the top where it's lonely
I got everybody mean-mugging like Nick Nolte
But nah, I won't stop, won't drop, won't retire
I am my own supplier, selling goods to the buyer
The torch to the eye of the storm that's on fire
The native translator, each jawn'll chart higher
They requested my IG, I replied deny
Tell me I'm in the top three, they ain't never lied
Stop through in that Peking to Paris, what a ride
The car's two-to-five, the doors suicide
Testin' the Thought'll be your suicide
No matter which corner of the globe you reside
2-1-5, dumb shit aside
When it comes to the job getting done, what am I?
The god of the microphone, praise the Lord
Anybody disagree with me, then raise your sword
I'm Agent Orange, poisonous amazing poems
And the band keeps raging on; listen to me, I won't⁠—
Don't stop, nope, I don't quit
Yo, I don't stop, yo, I don't quitYou might also like3Embed
