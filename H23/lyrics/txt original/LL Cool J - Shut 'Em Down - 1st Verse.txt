1 ContributorFor Me Lyrics(1st Verse)
When its go time all of your niggas is gone/
When its showtime i kill every stage that i'm on/
When its hoe time me and my bitch get it on/
Ain't got no time for niggas that ain't got no grind/
See me and mine we after this chicken after the paper/
Hit Trinidad right after Jamaica i'm talking my chick and blowing some reefer/
9's Cool grey my favorite sneaker in love with your girl then i shouldn't meet her/
I turn em to sluts skeet on the cheek em while playing this fire from out the speakers its Me/
They call me Flyy Guy/
I'll be up in the pussy you niggas is thigh highs/
Guess that mean you came up short TRon said kill em naa change of thought/
Take him cut his tongue out sew his lips shut now nigga can't talk in court/
Speaking of court none of yall can hold me/
Try it your life is at stake get eight to chest that's my Kobe/
Can't bare to see me eat nigga i'm out here like Yogi/
With ya Boo Boo as my sidekick your wife is everybody side chick/ got damn
