16 ContributorsTake Your Halo Lyrics[Intro]
You either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain

[Verse 1]
When you way up high in your prayed up sky
Displayed trust they cut, then your days must die
First you're flying up, up away, then you dying another day
Not aligned with kindness, the denying of what you say
I've been dope for a long time, collaboration's a long line
People ringing the phone line, 'cause they really want N9ne, love is the shown sign
But the blown minds over time they coming at you with the wrong kind of еnergy like an enеmy condone crime
Wanna finish me but infinity, my song shine
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
How they wishin' the six feet below for me
When I'm giving them respect and dough for B
Make you never wanna connect with people socially
Gotta lay low 'cause outta nowhere, no fair, people turn on you like Fredo
Hit you with the Draco
They'll erase your day bro, the evil wanna come and try to take your halo

[Chorus]
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em

I'm mad, still I'm mad
How a great can be taken by slimebag
Now the N9ne ask what the mind has when it can make you murder somebody dope as dimebag
If I seen ya, I'ma bring ya whatever you want from Tecca N9na
Build the king up, cut your wings bruh
Then fall down, look how we lost Selena
Damn shame, how can you believe how the fan changed
From hot and sunny with champagne to cold and gloomy and Samhain with the vamp fangs
I don't know how it turned into a situation to the highest degree
By the people claiming that they love us steppin' to me then you'll see what the riot could be

[Chorus]
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em

[Verse 3]
They want you to be the bad guy so bad
So glad when an ex artist talking greazy on us, they are only giving the shit mo' gas
Dirt on Strange? (What?) I want you to blurt on mane
Come on and bring the word on lame (Come on)
Capping is why you deserve wrong things (Curved on fame)
Say bro, you need some Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō
If you're no longer on the label, that you hate so
Don't be silent, you got it, bring that shit to the table
I said
[Chorus]
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em
They go, from bringin' you up then take you way low
See the God in you, then take your halo
Everybody say yes until they say no
Gotta watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em, watch 'em

[Verse 4]
And I will not stop, giving real op shots
What you feel got squashed in the truth and your spill got blocked
Because all I see, them saying "It's all about me"
Hell yeah 'cause your tall guap fee came from us, without it, y'all got free
And you fucked up fans threaten us, so what's the plan?
Talking tough stuff man, you don't really wanna buss or clutch hands
You don't pull up, you just yell sick
Nigga that ain't my sales pitch
Fucking infidels, I take 'em into hell and fuck jail bitch8Embed
