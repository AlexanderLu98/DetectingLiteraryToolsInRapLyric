2 ContributorsSo Good LyricsI'm in it
Swear that I'm about my business
Excuse the arrogance but its myself is who I'm feeling
Pause
Stretching out like pilates
Cool it J you too cocky
No stressin' over here I'm cooling that's word to mani
Await the day, that I could say
Girl back it up, I'm finally famous
Yes I do it, yes I do it
J.G.O. that be the movement goin' in
If you see a 6'9 dude with me that's lynn
Getting better sometimes flaunt it watching bad women get on it
Ahh…..ahh….ahhh…
Far from done, looking at her like that's game she know that she ain't the one
Treat em' all like it's just tretris it's a shame what i've become
I be going through my blackberry and texting girls for fun, I'm on one
So supreme, like the clothes that I be rocking
J.G.O. up in that reckless all this heat that we be dropping
Yeah I see it, yeah I see it
I just don't bother to mention how the more that we be grinding
Man the rep just getting bigger

That J.G.O. and that Reckless(4x)

Got em', so easy to spot em'
I be posted up on 5th ave I don't care whoever watching
All on me, I deliver
Don't believe? just hear and see
Please don't laugh cuz it ain't funny
And that's word to Joshton Peas
Oweee I'm cold, that boy gold
I see why ex-girls can't let go
So I call her over now and then I tell that broad get low
Drop it lower, yeah okay
She know J-Will I don't play
She the nfl and nhl and I'm the nba
Yeah that westside, that westside, story with two Y's
Yeah that just be the word around and we blowing up and they hold us down
What it do, these are flows I flows I bring to you
It attempts to come through on everything I'd say I'd do
Staying true
Time to ball the motto "we want it all"
That's only why we goon do it or else we wouldn't be involved
I'm ready for what it is, I'm ready for just whatever
I'm starting to find my lane man I couldn't feel better ahhh
