28 ContributorsThe Purple Tape Lyrics[Intro: Method Man]
I, fifty-eight, fifty-seven
Yeah, got you
A'ight, ayy

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wu's up, W's up
If y'all ain't with us, chuck a deuce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Let's see if they can hang, I'm already tying the snoose up (Ah)
I'm too hot, if you not, get you stuffed (Stuffed)
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut (Damn)
Young buck, I'm just trying to toughen you up (Yeah)
Can't let you hustle with us, y'all ain't struggled enough (Nah)
Y'all been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans, here's a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I ain't saying I'm perfect (Yeah)
And I ain't cursing the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive (Woo)
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that prometh' and the soda, come with the purchase

[Chorus: Method Man & Rae Smith]
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon, no relation to Chef though, but still trend
My youngin' tell 'em it's them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell 'em again
Wu-Tang is for the children

Lab with the pole, she slide down, I'm in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestacks
H-S-B see me getting g-packs, herringbones, mad stones in 'em
The voice is olive green, three doors, I'm on and bring my goons home
Puma's on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me? Just sue me homes
Yeah, half Mike, half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkey's out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably where the way it be rolling
Let's catch a check y'all, bring the broads here
Until the sun burn out, ain't nobody eating (Nigga)
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

[Chorus: Method Man & Rae Smith]
Who is that up in the building?

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
I'm still buzzin', this is Hennessey the next morning
They upset talking, I'm yes y'allin for checks
Boss on the set, you acting like my ex calling
Ain't that a bitch, not the five or the six
I rock seven on my back, that's Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion, I ain't having it
S-I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, what's happening?
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
Four, five, six, your head's crackin'
Just a fifth of E&J, plus a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make 'em lean
I'm running with the real, y'all chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for they favorite team

[Chorus: Method Man & Rae Smith]
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon, no relation to Chef though, but still trend
My youngin' tell 'em it's them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell 'em again

Raekwon, no relation to Chef though, but still trend
My youngin' tell 'em it's them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell 'em again
Wu-Tang is for the children3Embed
