1 ContributorStarman and Starboy Part 1. Lyrics(Intro)
Ain’t no joyful moment just feeling like I should go away from this maze”

(Verse 1)
I’m going in like a nighter, bitches be saying stuff like “are your feeling musty” but I ain’t rising like a sonic 06 knight so I’m not rusty
‘Cause bitch I’m feeling like juice wrld don’t fuck with me (don’t fuck)
Just like the rock, but nah I’m playin’ I just wanna put you in the worst mood ah like a wise classical guy said no shit so I’m takin’ Ws said no brood, P1 steamer like the weeknd so no I don’t my want my eyes blinded by the lights like blinding lights, Milli' point two just too hurt People giving me bad vibes and saying “i ain’t gon make it”, I always said I’m a be the greatest artist off all time like Just no one said it better then me but sometimes your mind be playing the menace in the society game and that bitch turns into a hangman so don’t hang up on me again man, calling in ill for dissing for someones else’s ass to say it,  I come with a vinyl player and I throw it off sideway just to see if someone’s gonna walk on the sidewalks, I have to know that I feel like I’m on another planet, because Nobody really understands me and even god won’t stop and I ask him to stop but he act’s hella weird and even questions my existence, Y’all say way too much about me like we get it “I am that guy?” But it won’t just stop and let me work on music for the masses, when they tellin’ me to say it way more, back you in the corner so it’s a pain hub and you know... not P-Hub!, Plus, I’m off the breaks hangman, so don’t play with me please and I accomplished,  so don’t go off to me like that I got money in my bank in the back  ‘Cause last time I checked I was a star boy, whore

(Hook 1)
A centerpeice ah, Cause I’m a masterpiece (Hell yeah)
I’m a cut you off like IKEA
Don’t be so obsessed with me
We will see you little obsidians
And you a ghost So you lookin’ so fine
Will they see me that way I do
‘Cause I’m a fly on the star like a starman and view like a starboy
Look what you have saw
Cause I’m a fly on the star like a starman and view like a starboy

(Verse 2)
Kinda like Earl Sweatshirt but I ain’t gettin’ my sweating in my shirt, you a trash one you don’t gave a damn ‘Cause I’m getting judge by the them beautifully ‘Cause of my bangers I released that I put out on a day to day basses, at least I’m feelin’ like a motherfucking starboy
No B-Shtting, and if Annie isn’t ok then I’m a moonwalking in like Michael Jackson, I’mma to test your hearts to the ground up
You I’ll cry when I become the king of the music industry, for you it will be the saddest  day than when hit the charts, what I mean by a P3 Cleana like a beautiful Latina, I guess gotta catch up
