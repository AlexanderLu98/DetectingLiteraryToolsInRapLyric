22 ContributorsFire In My Heart Lyrics[Intro: Adele]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Verse 1]
June 20th a Gemini is born
Ain't no secret I'm murdering anything I get on
Ain't no reason for surgery, silence, so we can mourn
I literally leave a murder scene every time I perform
It's a state of emergency, been a bit of a disturbance, see
Artists showin' no courtesy, rap is out of its form
Should be locked up for perjury, lyin' about what you're doin'
Sellin' your soul for currency, anything to get on
Hell is for an eternity, hope you know where you're goin'
An industry full of wannabes, never will I conform
I'm light years ahead of you rappers that started flowin'
And half of the ones that got it don't even know what they doin'
You write a rap and it's wack, it's the rappers that you influence
So backwards half of the time, don't know if you're comin' or goin'
Your lack of passion for rap is the reason rap has been ruined
The fashion is where your passion is, that's what you should be doin'
They claim they cut from the fabrics that they paint in their drawings
But as soon as they get to eatin' you're back and touchin' your groin, so
Riddle me, riddle me, how many rappers physically
Drizzle with the ability, that can mess with me lyrically
Mimic or even mirror me, hell will freeze over literally
Wildebeest with the similes, metaphors and agility
Little you to belittle me, jealous of what I'm willed to be
Still a beast with the killer speech
If it's mental then it'll be typically easy as me on top of this instrumental beat
I'm a problem, admit it you scared, Imma make it hard to eat
Still a gorilla killer, retardedly solemnly swore that I would go get it scared
Well you oughta be called a priest if he really should kill a prayer and prophecy
Follows me through the wilderness, Father put me where I should be
Pray that the shawties follow me
But I ain't follow Chuck D
Give 'em visions so they can see
But Waka Flocka to them is who B.I.G. was to me
2Pac on that hologram could never replace the grief
And had he still been alive you rappers would never be
Don't act as if you're surprised, you know it as well as me
Just happened to be the guy to report it on a CD
I listen to artists and be like, "Man, he listen to me"
Steal your ingredients but they don't want to let you to eat
Got friends that's envious of the talent cause I'm a beast
Mad at me for reachin' the levels that I done reached
Fell off? I wasn't ready to feast
I walked away from the table and Drizzy sat in the seat
Knock it off with the fables, 'fore you put me to sleep
Gemstones for life's the logo, loco with the speech
These artists are so-so, they just hidin' behind the beat
The production is dope though, so it's harder for you to peep
And you fall for the bozos, spittin' bars like they ain't weak on these blogs
And got the nerve to be salty at Chief Keef
The way the industry doggin' these elites (I'm appalled)
Got the people in awe, like these beats (and they frauds)
They'll hop on anything dog with a sweet leaf (like a frog)
Are we mentally all in a deep sleep? (from the fog)
They've offended me and all of these bleep bleeps
With a God and they think they don't amended me all cause I speak deep
But I'm Jaws, I'll eat anything numb with these teeth
Through the walls of this weak industry, targetin' these geeks
For the cause, until I diminish them all and they retreat and dissolve
I'm academically out of these boys reach
I've evolved to destroy anything bloggin' and retweet
I'll be doggin' 'til I'm frozen in a coffin and deceased
Lyrical miracle since they cut my umbilical
Still a fool with the syllables, guess you think it's some spiritual
I will cook up a batch of these bomb atomically chemicals
Pick up scoop and sling it right at you like some gorilla poop
Killa shoot if he feel like he thrilla, hope you gorilla proof
Still the truth, I suggest that you kneel and stoop, I conceal a nuke
That was proof 'fore I killed the booth, just as easy as peelin' fruit
Pitiful, I should steal on you for misleadin' our little youth
You might also like[Outro]
You're gonna wish you (never had met me)
All you rappers, all you rappers
All you fake MC's that's misleadin' our youth
Talkin' about cars that you ain't got, crack that you never sold
Neighborhoods that you know that you can't go in
You ain't real, be yourself
It's Gemstones
It ain't no question who's the elephant in the room
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Shout out to Adele
