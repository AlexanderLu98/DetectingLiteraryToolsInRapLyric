6 ContributorsSoldiers Fallen LyricsStay alive
Keep on striving
These are darker times
We are not confined, no
Soldiers fallen we have left behind
We will fight for them and all mankind
Reach is doomed to fall, but we stand high
We will fight for all until we die
Overrun
Our broken world, it crumbles under our feet
But we're not done
Our pain and suffering will end when they meet their defeat
Sing this anthem, bring it to the skies
We shall be victorious tonight
Reach is doomed to fall, but we stand high
We will fight for all until we die
There is no end to glory
There is no end to hate
But look for light at the end
And you will find your fate
These aliens play dirty
But we all know their place
They're here to overtake
But we'll just punch them in the face
This is our last stand
Our legend will remain
Everyone on my command
We will not die in vain
Humanity's final hope
And we will never fear
Now sing the anthem proud
For everyone to hear
Soldiers fallen we have left behind
We will fight for them and all mankind
Reach is doomed to fall, but we stand high
We will fight for all until we dieYou might also likeEmbed
