1 ContributorDown to Soil (The Hunt) LyricsHook:
{I’m] the Azmatic, that’s A Z the M C
Writing rhymes like the next K D O T
Laying down some tracks like the B and O
To find the D J Sabzi to my G-E-O

Verse 1:
So you ask what’s the purpose of these prophecies?
I write on themes, it’s no magic, I’m thematic
It’s why I been asking questions
About this life that we’ve all been living
Like a car I’m feeling driven
Like a card, I have been flipped
I sipped the water, and then I slipped
Into the abyss, I don’t want to miss
My chance to get my recognition
Yeah, the cake and ladies that all come with it
That’s here and there, gone in a minute
But while I’m here, I’m going to get up in it
I while away, the days of the year
I walled away, all of my fear
Now I live in love, I got in gear
The time is now, the place is here
Hook x2

Verse 2:
I’m rounding the bend, bending the rules
Ruling the world, schooling the fools
Pooling the money to do good for the world
Getting the juice and I’m getting the girls
But her hard to get, it's been getting me hard
Yo I started rapping, but now I’m departed
Not deported, near the border
Open up, and embrace the foreigner
New ideas so y’all think we’re scary
Quite contrary, we’re very merry we
Very royal, we’re born of kings
But I’m down to soil, know everything
No! Everything? Yo, everything!
I know everything, But some’s forgotten
Forget the old ideas, they’re rotten
Open your mind, pure white like cotton this

I been writing for some time, perfecting the rhyme
This is more than a one-line, or just a pastime
Though I do it to pass time, I give it some meaning
The feeling of flowing, infusing facts is freeing
But the music, the beat, it’s what gives me my energy
Inspires the ideas, the track like a friend to me
We have a conversation, about respect for the artist
The skill of making music speak is one of the hardest
So I’m looking for someone that’s going to take the shit seriously
We got a shared vision, doesn’t matter if they near to me
Fam in chicago, but I’m at school in 504
With the internet now that doesn’t matter no more
So Dj’s producers hit me up if you feel it
I promise you that what I spit exclusively real shit
I kill it, no Achilles heel, I’m feeling
Like a one in a billion, so take a chance when I deal it this
