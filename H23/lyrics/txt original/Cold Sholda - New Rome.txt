1 ContributorReady? LyricsI specialize in havoc and haphazardry
Say you put in practice but you couldn't handle half of me
Rework ya strategy or change ya galaxy
I am ya majesty and won't allow that blasphemy
No allergy, nothing to sneeze at
The flow's butter baby you can believe that
Fake smiles, hoes know where to cheese at
Not broccoli when I ask where the trees at
Alright Tinactin, quit the tough acting
I see no guns blasting, I know you just rapping
Whats cracking, my plans just hatching
Rapping like a rubberband but I'm the one snapping
Fuck a closed mind gone catch a clothesline
Bright future gone shine like a goldmine
Every heightened syllable is a bump of my dope rhyme
Thats a dope line, so dope you can snort mine

Are you sure man
Just take a second
Really think about it
Cuz I don't think you are
I don't think they ready, nothing bout'em says so
I think I'm Tom Brady, these suckas are Bledsoe [x2]

Oww, Mr. Swing check the method
Once you know the name next step is respect it
Animalistic on the beats I'm four-legged
Kicking hard shit when my foot was cemented
Tell the fellas I'm good, word up to Deniro
All cherry gotta keep the rhyming maraschino
Got one word for the steelo, it's primo
The frozen one flowing degrees beneath zero
The cold flows got my nose froze
Redder than Emma Stone on her heaviest flows
Thinking bout skipping college, I'm ready for the pro's
My veins pumping knowledge they ain't ready for the prose
They all know, the new challenger approaches
Rose through the ranks skills pure as a lotus
Take notice of what this pen composes
Delivering your daily overdose of dopeness
You might also likeAre you sure man
Just take a second
Really think about it
Cuz I don't think you are
I don't think they ready, nothing bout'em says so
I think I'm Tom Brady, these suckas are Bledsoe [x2]

Uhhh, through the fire and the flames
See right through all the liars and the lames
Tongue like a lit Bic smoking the mic
Dank flows so you know we smoking it right
Flick the flame to the Jane and we on our merry way
Living life in slow motion, a highlight everyday
Screw a Top 10 bitch I'm fit for a Top 5
Keep flapping ya gums kid but shit you are not fly
So sorry, my hearts froze over
Serve it hot on the mic, but give'em the cold shoulder
Shows over, up next is the curtain call
Leave the stage ablaze and thats for certain y'all
The roof?! You know that roof is on fire
The mic arsonist flamethrower for hire
Be cautious cuz I'm heating up ya mental
Too hot to touch too sweet for ya dental

Are you sure man
Just take a second
Really think about it
Cuz I don't think you are
I don't think they ready, nothing bout'em says so
I think I'm Tom Brady, these suckas are Bledsoe [x2]Embed
