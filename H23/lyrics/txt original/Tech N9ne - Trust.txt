Focus on it every single day, I wanna figure out a way
To get ahead of what I think I know is comin'
It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem
As if you've never been afraid, then why you runnin'?
I could never look at what I do the way that other people can
And walk away, I can't be separated from it
Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at
You wanna cut it up but can't, man, they can never take it from me
(I'm) Outlandish, take chances
Gotta get it while I can with my damage
My sanity could leave but if it vanished
Don't matter to me, I'd still manage
Gue-guеss you could say I'm at an advantage
My vantage point can be quitе lavish
Got so many cadences, no way to pick
One, which bag is my hand in
Depends what mood I'm in
Oh, no, I'm in a mood again
Lord knows I'm a hooligan
Losin' it, who can get gruesome with
You if it comes down to it?
You can bet I shoot direct, defuse the threat
And they wonder why the music has a huge effect?
Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth?
'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up
And want the music with the visuals, I got a vendetta
For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up
But take away the happiness, it can be kinda pathetic
But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache
I gotta be honest, I really been the cause of it, get it
'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see, you can tell
When I'm at the breakin' point, I finally had to sit with the devil
I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is, yellin'
He tried to get me to live with him, even called me a sinner
And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner
So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up?
I took a moment, thought about it, feelin' caught in the middle
But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel
And I can never leave it, even if I made it to Heaven
He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me
I'm like, "Woah (Woah), hold up, I don't think so"
Skin and bones meet my ego
How's he look? He don't eat much
Let him starve, I don't feed him
I just beat him, I just leave him in his womb, in the fetal
Let him cry, let him yell, let him scream, I don't need him
Lift off when I'm ticked off, my pitfalls I latch on to like a pit dog
I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live
Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick
I hide in, wanna watch? Dive right in
My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin'
Just means I'm careful with the time I spend, so

(Look, look) Look what I, look what I done (Ayy)
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)
My life is not what it was (No)
I'll do whatever I must (Woo)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust (Yeah)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne & NF]
Tech N9na, next king up
Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer
That lingua vexing ya
Leavin' a regular rapper resting, bruh (Chyeah)
This is what, I give it such
An incredible wicked rush, a vivid gush
Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff
Said, I better go rip it rough and I lit it up
The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (Whoop)
Lyrically elect me, Jet Li
The beat, it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (Whoop)
That is tellin' me "Let's feed"
On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus
Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest
Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive
A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (Chyeah)
The boogie monster reppin' with NF in the hoodie
Want to step into the session and fully conquer
The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (Chyeah)
Left in a wreck, never checkin' nor could he stomp us
Take his crown
Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakeish frown
Shake his ground
Like I'm the Mechagodzilla, I'm such a killer when I break it down (Uh)
These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes
That need those elite bros with the heat, so
They can eat on the D low
Off a beast yo' ego, got it vetoed (Chyeah)
Please close your beak foes, delete scrolls
Taken from me, thieves chose to try to decode (Chyeah)
Reload the beat, so I can reach each soul
No cease, no finito, release (Go!)
I am the chosen and everyone is beholdin'
My energy is golden 'cause dominion is being broken
From enemies in the open approachin', I'm never jokin'
The remedy bein' spoken, I'm hopin' that you're soakin' it up (Chyeah)
I'm in the motion, I'm dope and I'm never chokin'
My devotion to floatin' like an ocean, the Holy Ghost and
I'm scopin' the evil folk and revokin' the wicked notion
I'm croakin', I'm really floatin' and quotin' that I'm closin' it up (Chyeah)
Talkin' behind my back
End up where N9ne is at see me and say
Kinda wack, you could not find the knack
Hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray
I'ma beat you 'cause I'm greedy and slay, if you're creepy and cray
I'ma eat you like PB&J, kiwi and grapes
I'ma demolish 'em when the T be in play, pray!
A stunna recordin' in my number three Jordans
Dungaree sportin', the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin'
The punishin' hunter eat like a hung-ary orphan (Chyeah)
T9 and NF are elephants
In the room without a closet for skeletons
Quit embellishin', a demon from hell is sent
Yell it went, Donny, you're outta your element! (Ayy)
[Chorus: NF]
Look what I, look what I done (Ayy)
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)
My life is not what it was (No)
I'll do whatever I must (Woo)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust (Yeah)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Look what I, look what I done (What I done)
Helpin' 'em people I love (I love)
My life is not what it was (No)
I'll do whatever I must (Woo)
Count on one hand who I trust (I trust; ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust (I trust; yeah)
Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy)
Count on one hand who I trust95Embed
