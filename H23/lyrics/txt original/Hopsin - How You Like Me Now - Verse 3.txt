1 ContributorBurn one LyricsChorus
Put in work nigha earn something
Smoke with the chief nigha burn one
Take notes you might learn something
Im a show you how to get the job done
They asking where you get your style from
Riding till i see the outcome
Had to rack it up by my only
Better bag back you dont know me

Verse 1
Certified i put that on my name
Heartless nigha i gave that to the game
Life is good dawg i can't complain
Squared up and it was never the same
Hardest to tame hopping off a plane
Rocks or stocks to me its all the same
Flip reup then flip again
Keep it rolling like michelin
Never ever going broke again
Hit the block ten to ten to secure the win
Young nigha winning on all fronts
With a fat blunt and a double cup
Talk is cheap bb the beef its all good till you show your teeth
Best keep it g when you fuck with me
Have to pop your top and put an opp to sleep

Verse 2
If God is working then so am i
Keepitaplus i ain't selling out
Building slow waiting on a big amount
Thats another M is you keeping count
Rich even if i never laid a verse
Got a hustle hand out this universe
Shooting for the stars land on a cloud we was on the block smoking black and milds
Ill be around ain't no backing down
When im in your town how you like me now
Lil boosie nigha wipe me down
Only real nighas built for the crown
Best keep your or else run the jewels
Same circle i dont pick and choose
Find your spark and then light the fuse
Better burn one and then make the news

Verse 3

P o m e pull back the curtain tell me what you see
Im in a different league
Making moves at a different speed
They talking down but they still in need
Good weed is the remedy
More letters in the street than Tennessee
Schooling nighas elementary somebody pray for my enemies
Best in the flesh outwork the rest
Need a libra scale to measure success
Going for mines can't settle for less energized got to confess im blessed
Come up from nothing im making my mark
Building it up just to take it apart
Break it down break it down nighas
Distribute and flood the town nigha
