5 ContributorsSailor Mars Lyrics[Verse]
I fuck up all the time
It's a shame you used to hearin' it
They say that love is blind
If you ask me, it's just bullshit
It's all a waste of time
It's so sad I feel fear for me
Some would rather die
Than sit here and ignore the shit
I've been so hurt, I didn't wanna stay this long, I had to free myself
All of my love for you is tumblin' down, and you didn't help
Your love is supersonic, your love is supersonic
It's supersonic, your love is supersonic

[Chorus]
In the meantime, you know, between time
You and I, we can find time
Find time and you and I
Nobody else until we die, until we die
In the meantime, you know, between time
How 'bout you and I, we find time
Find time and you and I
Just us until we die, until we die

[Outro]
