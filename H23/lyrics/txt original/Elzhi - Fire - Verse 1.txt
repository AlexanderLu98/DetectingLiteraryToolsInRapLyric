1 ContributorTalking Lyrics{Produced by NY Bangers}

{Intro: Elohin}
Are you serious man
You got to be kidding me right now

{Hook: Elohin}
They talk a lot but they don't make since
But I ain't gone stress out
I know somebody might take offense
But that should bring their best out

{Verse 1: Elohin}
They talking dollars, I'm pulling up in a gray Impala
Probably thinking that I'm garbage or just a waste of talent
Sauna hot but that probably don't coincide with
The fact that I'm underground cause my topics are not to popular
The fear of God is the wisdom that I embody
Somebody bothered by all of the honesty in my product
Born in the 80's the era of Reaganomics
From Bush, Clinton to Bush then Obama and now it's Donald
My biggest problem is the, problem of fake persona's
You need to step to the side.just like a maid of honor
These synthetic artist is soft as a baby's bottom
Ashamed of yourself so you model all the gimmicks you follow
Here we go again, why you going off again
Step inside the booth rappers shaking like it's parkinson's
The game cooled off so, I'ma make it hot again
Salivating gasoline spit fire arsonist
You might also like{Hook: Elohin}
They talk a lot but they don't make since
But I ain't gone stress out
I know somebody might take offense
But that should bring their best out
When I breathe on the mic they scared they don't know what I'm gone do
They don't know what I'm gone do
Until I'm dead and I'm laying in the casket I'ma stay true

{Verse 2: Elohin}
I'm aiming at cha, and bring disasters by changing chapters
Like Martin Lawrence get to stepping like a Beta Kappa
I learned to master the art of rapping by looking back at
All the times in life when I overcame something tragic happening
You think I'm laughing I'm serious like an athlete
That's training out in the desert but sweat is the only drink he's having
No longer passive, I'm moving past it like moving traffic
Reversed feet, you face forward but you step backwards
Listen, you ain't got the stamina to
Even step in the booth with me, you're just an amateur dude
It'll cost you a brain cell, this actually truth
'Cause the struggles I had in life you couldn't walk in my shoes
What you know about growing up and your pops ain't around
But you learned how to forgive him so you walk with a smile
What you know about married life staying faithful and true
What you know about raising kids like a father should do
That's grown man talk
{Hook: Elohin}
They talk a lot but they don't make since
But I ain't gone stress out
I know somebody might take offense
But that should bring their best out
When I breathe on the mic they scared they don't know what I'm gone do
They don't know what I'm gone do
Until I'm dead and I'm laying in the casket I'ma stay true
Yeah I'ma stay true

{Verse 3: Elohin}
I stay alarmed like a prophet or a prophetess
But y'all don't see the horns like the head of a baphomet
Staying cautious 'cause I could caution a consequence
That could cause a target to follow me cause I'm not convinced
Some snapchat it, some people go tweet about it
Instagram it facebook it, but never gone be about it
I'm the type to write a song and get people to sing about it
Speak about it, write a book and get people to read about it
Let's move

{Hook: Elohin}
They talk a lot but they don't make since
But I ain't gone stress out
I know somebody might take offense
But that should bring their best out
When I breathe on the mic they scared they don't know what I'm gone do
They don't know what I'm gone do
Until I'm dead and I'm laying in the casket I'ma stay true
Yeah I'ma stay trueEmbed
