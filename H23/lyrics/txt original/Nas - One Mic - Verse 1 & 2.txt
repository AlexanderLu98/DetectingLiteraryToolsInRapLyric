Pull myself out from a deadbeat, man
Fuck up the basement, im gonna ascend
I drive it myself like its stolen
Juggle the puddle im juggin the benz

Everybody said im a dead man in a wasteland
"He got no plan he got sense, right?"
Everybody haven't seen my left hand in a weapon no love or compassion aight

NARRATIVE 2 [DON O'DEELIO]
O God, don't get me started again with Fat B bro, like
It's in his name, he's fat as fuck

CHORUS 1 [QUEST]
Get the fuck out of my kitchen we making plates out of vision
It really is do or die so dont you follow me follow me, follow

VERSE 2 [QUEST]
Been through physical pain, been through traumatic shit, but scatt on a gat
To put all my set in a different new level
Im holding the grudge as a gavel
In a marathon of a violence give me the baton
Better die you tikos better die if you pro-silence
Jump really gotta jump from the bandwagon
No more fuckin culture scene and balance
NARRATIVE 3 [DON O'DEELIO]
Gawd damn, is it almost Anima bro?
Yo that dude is too... ahh get the fuck outta here

CHORUS 2 [QUEST]
Get the fuck out of my kitchen we making plates out of vision
It really is do or die so dont you follow me follow me, follow

INTERLUDE 3 [ANIMA]
(Like what, like what, like what)
Jump to the pit like there ain't tomorrow (Like what?)
Jump to the pit like there ain't tomorrow
(Go)

VERSE 3 [ANIMA]
Hit the spot
Symptomatic call the doc (Call the doc)
Leave em dead on the spot (Now they ghost)
Never give fuck till i rot

All of the pain
All of the shame
All of the people they all facade
Look at my face look at my eye
Hold it man lemme fuck ya cam
When they start to shoot lemme bang this jam
God want the blood
They be damn
Anima's out
Here lies his soul bitch
NARRATIVE 4 [DON O'DEELIO]
Oh, i just remembered
It's that small ass tiko
Like, that dude can't write lyrics for shit
Why do y'all listen to this shit
He can't even rap

VERSE 4 [HAZY DAEL]
Yea i’m that Hazy motherfucker
Talk to me you’ll know your place
Ain’t no shame upon my title
Speak to me ends with Your grace
A descendant of a King and now ascending as He did
Had a Quest from book Isiah
Fract a deal or BET, uh
Posse on venture
Fuck the queen and over
Yes sir
Lived the life
Probably get the grams
Instant
Pussy wet
But i stay lit
I ain’t off white or that bape shit
All the tikos fakin
But i keep it legit
If im ridin with PE
I’m stayin so fit

VERSE 5 [ISIAH]
From my big brother Q
To ma lil homie dael
Fresh out the oven throwin heat up in the air
The scene is kingdom come
We kill kings, we the heir
Broncco be the motive
Lawless, like whats a jail?

Uhmm
Got a fucking bakery while yall live on breadcrumbs
‘fuego’s glued up to your ears
Call us sticky napalm
Servin tunes so hard like an erection
Put us on a pedestal
Its a fixed election

Yea we’re underdogs but we never going under, dawg
These tikos need a beating
Do a manny pacquiao
U got a cuban link, but still ain't got no cuban links
Lotta grudge for the game
I think i need a shrink

Lil boy stay hot he incinerated
Tikos can't touch dis like ‘see ya later’
We sculpt the scene you would think its play do
Your shits premature
Heres an incubator

VERSE 6 [BERTRAND]
(Fat B you better wake the fuck up)
Wake up, really wanna bake up
Seeing people fake up, they put the make up on
In Jamaica, feel like UnderTaker, going off the radar
Sharpen like a razor and let time flies

Think about the future, cuz what’s on the past should never confuse you
There’s one mic, one king, gun fights and one ring
How you gon’ fly with one wing?

OUTRO HOOK [BERTRAND]
I got one love, one love, one love, one love, one love 4xEmbed
