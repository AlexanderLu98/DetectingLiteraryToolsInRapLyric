1 ContributorError Era Lyrics[Intro: Dr Koul & Imagine]
Yo, uh
S-K-D (motherf*****)
(DJ, y’all)
Come on, uh

[Dr Koul: Verse 1]
Break the machines like "error, error"
Breaking your dreams like "error, error"
Hate and deceit brings terror
Better learn before you burn, better late than never ever
Wage war with every page you turn, it's "error, error"
We use your drones against you
Your schools, your tools, it's all in a fool's errand
Your soul is spent through like the tip of a pencil
And the drip of a stencil, it's the end of the old era

[Imagine: Verse 2]
When is the right moment to make the best move
To keep your light glowing and let the rest groove
Lie in denial or choose to learn something
In the fire of desire who doesn’t burn something?
A trail of failure or a mountain of knowledge
In this fairy tale what does the coward acknowledge?
Open your mind and see what hides behind the scenes
It’s a thin line between you and I but we can find some peace

You're allowed to make mistakes but not to hide them
The underground ain't for fakes so don't try bluffing
You know you got what it takes when failure's not an option
Ride with precaution
You're allowed to make mistakes but not to hide them
The underground ain't for fakes so don't try bluffing
You know you got what it takes when failure's not an option
Ride with precaution

[Imagine: Verse 3]
Are you the yin or yang, why d’you stay in the ranks?
Who’s gonna fill the banks with no more bills to spend?
Watch them all kill the lands, how can they still pretend?
They made this shit commence, who’s gonna make it end?

[Dr Koul: Verse 4]
When perfection is impossible and error's unavoidable
The lesson is you've got to know your limits
And the choice is to let go and take the risk
Or let it roll and reposition
It's a battle of the wits so win or lose you’ll gain wisdom
The brain listens, the muscles are tamed with it
The aim's limited when you're stuck with the same gimmicks
We shuffle lyrics and spit with the greats in this game
We make business with chillers whose names will remain
[Imagine: Verse 5]
Yo it all goes together, everything’s connected
Mind body and soul, all should be respected
Stop looking for perfection, it doesn’t exist
Mistakes are new directions so that you can persist
Come on

[Chorus: Evita Koné]
You're allowed to make mistakes but not to hide them
The underground ain't for fakes so don't try bluffing
You know you got what it takes when failure's not an option
Ride with precaution
You're allowed to make mistakes but not to hide them
The underground ain't for fakes so don't try bluffing
You know you got what it takes when failure's not an option
Ride with precaution
