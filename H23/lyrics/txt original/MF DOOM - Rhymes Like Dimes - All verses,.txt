1 ContributorTo The Stars LyricsINTRO - M1 (OL)
She said that she wanna go to Mars
I said "Why don't we just go to Jupiter?"

HOOK - M1 (OL)
She said that she wanna go to Mars
I said "Why don't we just go to Jupiter?"
Now she wanna go look at all the stars
I told that bad bitch, "yeah, do not start."

She said that she wanna go to Mars
I said "Why don't we just go to Jupiter?"

I told that bad bitch, "yeah, do not start."

VERSE 1 - M1 (OL)
Taking flights, and I cannot end up last
See your baby mama and I might give it a pass
I was in and out of space, feeling like Neil Armstrong
Marijuana and the magnum got me flying to the stars

And I cannot feel my face when I have too much Hennessy
I love the feeling but I don't like what it does to me
Mummy said I need to slow down and just catch my breath
But I don't think I can do that, too much snakes around me
You might also likeI can see straight through them
Superpowers, you know I ain't human
I was rising like the Humit
Can't you see I'm scorching, I'm doing this

VERSE 2 - JD (OL)
She wants fly off Planet Earth, It ain't that hard
Welcome to my planet, Jupiter
Super Saiyan, I'm not playing, Let's go far
Let's take a tour with the stars in the car
Looking all fleeky, yeah I'm liking
She's riding on me like she's biking
Magical like Disney, she's excited
Late night trips like Peter Pan, yeah we're flying
Looking good,hit it like I should,when I'm in the hood
Do it all, If I really could, she misunderstood
On the blocks, just like Skeppy said, It ain't really safe
Gotta watch, over my shoulders, whenever I'm out late

MF Doom, Rhymes like Dimes, I wanna see all the brodies shine
She likes to call on my phone all the time, I put my pole up in her spine
Race in the whip, driving fast, change gears, music's so loud I can't hear
She helped me out on the lanes, bent over, I'm looking right at her rear
