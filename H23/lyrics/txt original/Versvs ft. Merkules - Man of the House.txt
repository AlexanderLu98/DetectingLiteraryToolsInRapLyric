3 ContributorsMan of the House LyricsHook:

Everytime I'm looking at myself and I doubt
I'm thinking "goddamit I'm out"
But the people need me to rip one more song up, guess it's what the fans are about
So I gotta just stand and be proud, can't stay on the ground
Can't let the family down
They say this game is my new home, well, I'm guessing I'm the man of the house
Goddamn!

Verse 1 (Versvs):

Ever since I was young, all the doubt came from my mind
Gotta stay on my grind, can't pay it no mind
I just gotta keep slaying every page, every rhyme
Any day, any time, like I spray with a Nine
Go insane it's a sign, cause every time I spit, I got it
So if I slip, no problem, it's only right they think I hit that bottom
Cause I came from behind
And now I'm chilling with some very fine bi**** and they mad
Cause they figured it is bed time
Giving me a headache like I'm sipping on some red wine
Gotta kill bars, cause I feel I got a deadline
Get it, deadline? Wait I can't just stop
Not even if my face got rocked or my brains got shot
Cause overtime they think I'm going down
I surprise them and I peak like it's GameStop stocks
Yeah, and I remember chilling in the car with her
Vibing and hearing Merkules ripping it
Now I got a track with the man, damn, and I don't even know if she's listening
But in doubt I keep killing it cause when defeat seems imminent I reach pinnacles
And I'm winning cause I recovered and I'm fu***** tracks up
ICloud, I ain't lost sh** since I got back up, so

Verse 2 (Merkules):

It's kind of crazy what's been happening now
There's blood rushing to my head until I had to sit down
Cause I was broke, all the sudden now I have this allowance
And cash and accounts, like what the fu**, I'm laughing out loud
I had to take a step back, it's a lot for me to grasp
But I put the work in instead of talking out my a**
I was haunted by my past, but the progress that I've had
Made it worth it, now me and Versvs are bodying a track
I don't care about the cost of the chain on your neck
Where I came from it was hard, you had to gain your respect
It was painful I guess, you can say that I'm blessed
Cause I made it and I'm thankful everyday for success
But a lot comes with it they don't warn you about
I used to think I had problems, I got more of them now
Like where the fu** do I begin? I'm still sorting them out
It's fu***** horrible the way I tend to torture myself
But I had to make a promise to the people I love
I stare deep into the mirror just to see who I was
Since I gave it my two cents I guess I'll keep it a buck
I've been feeling anxious, I think I need to get drunk
You know that feeling that you get when something's fu****** with you? Well that's my everyday struggle with this substance abuse
I guess I really used to think that I had something to prove
Now I'm the man of the house so I got nothing to prove
Fu** you!
