Back at it like a crack addict, Mr. Black Magic
Crack a bitch back, chiropractic, Craftmatic
Big daddy smokin' big Cali in a black alley
In a black Grand Natty rollin' down Old Natty
Hair nappy, matty as a black granddaddy, all fact
No cappin', fat, black boat captain stay floatin'
No flappin', wave runner, I'm a gunner
I'ma have your block hot as a sauna all summer
And I put that on Osama and my motherfuckin' mama
I'ma terrorize the actors playing like they want some drama
I'ma chop 'em with a chopper 'til I motherfuckin' drop 'em (Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em)

Stack addict, a mack with the blackest fabric on back
I magically rack it and dash while I'm duckin' rat-a-tat-tats
I'm runnin' the truck over sucker shit
Matter fact, kiss the ass and even the cra-a-ack
Automatic facts, it's like tha-a-at (Woo)
It's scammer bliss when you puttin' villains in charge of shit
All of us targeted, all we doin' is arguin'
Pardon them as they work until every pocket's been picked and soul been harvested
I'm ready to mob on these fuckin' charlatans (Charlatans, charlatans, charlatans, charlatans, charlatans, charlatans)
