Right on my tongue, look
Yo, check, my flow is unknown to man yet
Dammit, keep running around like an annual banquet
Made a withdrawal with your broad, she left the bank wet
Rub her like a condom contemplating dangerous sex
I'm unimpressed with your talent, skill still appeal
A maestro on the mic though, I'm almost ill as Camille for real
Ain't never runnin' from nothin', I'm fit to tread mills
Name another movement makin' time stand still
Hiiipower to the third degree
Murder, we emerged and it was an emergency
It's closed curtains for you worthless earthlings
Hurtin' cause I rise like mercury in the burning heat
Word on the street Soulo done done it again
Look at me, I used to match a dub sack with my friends
Now we smokin' by the O, like the letters P and N
Ain't have to start watching CNN for you to see an end
It's coming quicker than you think, don't mean to rub it in
Like lubriderm, but you should learn that you could never fuck with him
Ab's gettin' bigger, but I ain't do no sit-ups
Got the hiccups cause I keep puffin' Ports without the filter
Feel the vibe switch in every single room that I enter
Told my bitch to make room for a tomb for her placenta, nigga
I fuck her 'til she have a seizure in my leisure time
She know I love her, also know I don't need her
Cause I'm a king and I smoke a lot of weed
That makes sense, it's about 33 ounces in a liter
In layman's terms you lames had better pay respect
Or you'll be sleepin', they'll be at your wake payin' their respects
