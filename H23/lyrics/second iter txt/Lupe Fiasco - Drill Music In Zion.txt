The August symphonic, power of a Blahnik
To heal steel, medical bill drill harmonics
Silver sonnets from the "bonne nuits" and bonnets
I leave a whole sleeve down in Condoleezza's comments
Copper ebonics, competent and gannet
Godzilla's economics rock gondolas 'til you vomit
Bigger than the tongue and write signatures with a Thomas
Great Wall of China climber and Bonnie Woo correspondent
Opera onyx, popular's for convicts
Stay below the doppler, turn Robotniks into Sonics
Positioned jostlers, monitor hegemonics
Robots make the robots that solder thе electronics
Nostradamus couldn't bother to keep a promisе
Logic's on the rocket, what profit defeats a conscience?
Somebody's daughter is contemplating the convent
But a man with a dollar is slobbering for her haunches
Mouth is just watering for some nonsense
And this might be the moment her modeling probably launches
Gobbling collard greens through the rumpus
Washing gasoline, watch hollering, replace a congress
Golden gossiping auditing through my content
Running out of water, just pondering where the pond went
World's hottest summer, we're wondering if they pawned it
Desperate for the credits to come tumbling through the conflict, yeah
