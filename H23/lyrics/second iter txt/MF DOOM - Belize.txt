DOOM get rude with the dude off chips
The mood switch, he chewed off strips of a Broodwich
Danger make him groove off a glitch
Made your boo booty twitch and the crew rich, bitch
Always wanted to say that
Ever since the days in hallways tauntin' a stray cat
The one he often frequently slapped around
All the while, waited then graduated, cap and gown
Hated the rap sound
Debated the crap until he felt he had it mapped out
Enough to have the game trapped and bound
Scratchin' the crown with the names of lames who yapped the noun
Or verb, for that matter
Had no data for a herb who chat chatter
Oh, Erik Estrada
Fat rat, the mask made him batty as a mad hatter
Known for his absurd word choices
And will ignore you if you ask him if he heard voices
Look, the energy is crazy
Far as he was concerned, the enemy was lazy
Ahem, your attention please
Freeze, he came to seize the free cheese
Before he flees to Belize
In case you forgot to mention, squeeze these
Just keep it on a need-to-know basis
They knew he was a negro, so no need to show faces
Back in the days of no laces
On a slow pace, they used to say he might could go places
Meh, whatever the case is
The card he played was ace of spades, but no races
A spastic, some call loony
When he spit a tune sarcastic as Paul Mooney
