Now, should I slit my wrists? Go for it all or call it quits?
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record, and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedy's — above the law, fuck 'em all!
I'm coming for the rich, thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war, and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course, I bury any adversaries trying to floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave, getting minimum wage
Filling the gauge, front page, these are the last days!
Cash pays and rules — the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto
I ain't judging, but bugging, how we fall so many levels?
The devil's got us by the balls
That's why the law allows the drugs to overflood
Knowing we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ice is, and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime or through the Bible
Whichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal
