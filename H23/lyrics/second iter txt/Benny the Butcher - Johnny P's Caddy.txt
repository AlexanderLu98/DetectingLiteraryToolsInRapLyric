This ain't my story 'bout rags to riches, more 'bout how I mastered physics (Uh-huh)
In the game, I used to train like Rocky, catchin' chickens (Yeah)
I was nice, but they was right when they told me that rap a business
I had ten bands in my stash when I passed over half a million
Come easy? No good, don't be surprised I outlast these niggas
It's like they put out a smash then thеy gone in a flash, admit it
And then they makе tracks and diss us like that's gon' add up the digits (Fuck you doin'?)
They showin' fake racks in pictures like that's gon' attract the bitches
That was really me, nigga, I ain't have to act in Conflicted (Nah)
Only difference is I'm livin', and I would've whacked one of 'em niggas
Who knew that after drug dealin' I'd still be casual spending mil' plus?
Annual income, so here's my manual and then some
And this Eastside shit still in me
My ability to turn words to imagery prolly the reason they gon' remember me (Let's talk)
Figure me, walk this tightrope with a feline's agility
The streets did so much shit to me, I can never live civilly
I can never leave the scene without checkin' my mirrors visually (Mm-hmm)
Come with that energy 'cause some shit gon' always stick with me
They wanna know what I brought to Griselda, I say, "Validity"
They askin' "What work y'all niggas put in?", I'm like, "What didn't we?"
Problems that I correct through the obstacles I progress
Illogical for them to feel they responsible for our success
Besides Con' and West, tell me, who else I gotta respect?
