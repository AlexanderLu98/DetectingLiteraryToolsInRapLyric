Ayo, I'm from a back block on the east side, peace and war
Out on Leroy with the MAC on, peace Allah (Brr)
The whole portfolio is gangster, whip with cocaine
Just shot a nigga on the anklet (Boom, boom, boom), sellin' dope
Save this Persian rug five times a day, prayers, niggas tasteless
Cells pop, niggas came through, stabbed 'em on the wake up (Ah)
Niggas catch you at the showers for a hundred soups
Bubble goose, we pulled up in a couple coupes (Skrt)
The chopper on double loop (Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot)
Your body got hugged, but not enough to shoot
We baggin' up trouble at the W, what's up with you? We huntin' too (Ah)
Still plottin' and schemin', on the cot, daydreamin'
Get shot out the Heron, pray demon, you ain't breathin ' (Skrt, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
The yay reekin', lips movin', you ain't breathin'
You start coughin' up blood for the same reasons
You ever sold a hundred then spent it all in the same weekend?
Razors leave your face leakin' (Ah)
Chill, let the Wraith creep, and the brick broke in eight pieces
Double Cs on the suede sneakers, I kick the real shit
Who you be? Where you bome from? I had to build shit (Ah, I had to build shit, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
I had to build shit
