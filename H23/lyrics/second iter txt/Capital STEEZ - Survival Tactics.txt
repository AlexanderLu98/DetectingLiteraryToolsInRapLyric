It's like 6 milli' ways to die, my nigga, choose one
Doomsday comin', start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell 'em that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire, 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author, I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, I been the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons, homie, that's an A-bomb
Ugh, fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', "Fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys 'bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the bloodshed
'Cause nowadays for respect, you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzis 'cause it's given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond, nigga
