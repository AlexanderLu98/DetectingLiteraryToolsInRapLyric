Wow, these burdens are heavy
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be found
Am I a big ol' parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where I'm spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
Look, I'm tryna wash away my sins
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
So when it come to anybody, there's no trust for no one
Man, so what? My whole plan's to go nuts
My shoulders ready for more shrugs, I'm gon' judge
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (Hol' up)
My sanity's gone, I'd rather be torn
From this planet they planted me on, yes, that's a reward
I'm actually bored with having a sore heart
It's torn apart from a family that I don't have anymore (Man, hol' up)
I was livin' so oblivious
With millions, it really was a pity, huh? (A pity, huh?)
It's kinda funny what a penny does
Mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Life's got me by the neck, with a blade against it (What?)
Guess I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (What?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (What?)
So I'ma act out like a ragin' misfit (What?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (Yeah)
You wanna hate me? Good, great, terrific (Good)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wish list 'cause I

Yeah, manifested this
Do not treat me like some adolescent kid
I am prayin' to the Lord with the Book of James
Hopin' He gon' add my testament
This dark cloud, that's my residence
Demons knockin', I don't have to let 'em in
I done made mistakes, day to day
You probably can't relate
I just ain't the same when I'm lost (Lost)
