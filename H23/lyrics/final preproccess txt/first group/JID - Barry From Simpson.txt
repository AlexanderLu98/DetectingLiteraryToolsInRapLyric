Either you do or don't do it
If you put me to it, I'ma get it done (Gangsta Grillz)
From a city that don't see the sun
Either you a sinner or a citizen
Niggas ain't runnin', they gettin' guns or a chopper that's little as Big Sean
He on the block with that Barry Bonds
I was with Barry from Simpson (Shit)
Stockin' bonds, talkin' funds
Clockin' money, the game a jungle
We playin' Jumanji, I'm in Jamaica
JID playin' rugby, stand in my Vans
Stan Van Gundy, stand on my plan
Plant on my stands, man of my word, word up my man
Heard I got work, work what you serve, oh verse by versе
My verb like perc, I slow it down, my vеrse like syrup
I like the sound, gun rounds on mother Earth
With a little pump, you get smoked like Purrp
Get a nigga jumped, don't fuck up my shirt
Nigga J.I.D stand for "Jumped In Dirt"
When the Wesson squirt, it does wonderworks
'Till you with the monsters in the underearth

Either you do or don't do it
God put me to it, didn't help me through it
Homie had to work around the hood
But if heaven's waitin', what the hell we doing?
Back on Glenwood, lookin' for juugs
Black owned businesses distributin' goods
Put crack on blacks and then shackle a foot
They go back to back the way back to back (J-I-D)
And we was back in the woods, runnin' from white niggas
Night killers, tri-pillage, my village, trifling, idealist, identity crisis
I dig it, I get it, I've been in fights that I didn't win and I didn't die
But they didn't live, so we did it right
Better not get in if you're not gonna slide
'Cause you not gon' fit, just stay inside
Don't play no fence, no switch no sides
Go grab a switch, JID Jackson Five
Joe's whipping kids, Mike's still alive
Pour up some Prince, pro nigga rights
Hold up your fists, throw up your sign
Throw up your clique, throw down and fight
I fucked up my fit, but you ain't gon' hit 'cause I ain't no bitch
