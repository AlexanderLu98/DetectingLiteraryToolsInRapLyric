Turn a obstacle obsolete, turn a cheek, poverty
Heritage, cotton seed, I could be lotta things
Lottery winner, this album autobiography
I feel like Socrates, hypothesis: opposites attract
Squares around the block again
Turn a obstacle obsolete
I believe I can fly, "R Kelly," awkwardly
Ain't really popular, prolly 'cause they all doubted
But I was up while they slept
While they said I wouldn't amount to much, I was hit
I knew that if I ainâ€™t older, I
Turn a obstacle obsolete
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wop da bam
I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Still apply for the fall, cap and gown, for the fail
Furthermore, first of all, curtain call, shirt and tie
I'm a pallbearer, turn a obstacle course to a parquet
Weigh out a horse in a carriage, that wasn't in your inheritance
Splittin' parts as we jumpin' off of the porch again
Portuguese, we don't speak shit but poetry, hopelessly hope
The Lord'll see when our dreams get torn apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide, second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw
