What if you're the lone survivor
Last human ever known surviving alone
Last soul acquires the whole entire combined light of every living soul that died on the globe
Life twilight zone inspired
What's power in the hands of the only fiver is own
Nation of one, Earth if you don't divide her
Moses, Joseph, Job, Elijah
If they been waiting for the Sol Messiah and his holiest host
For holding a ghost inside of, I'm close
The divine chauffeur driver Jehova hired
The only rider he chose for guiding the coast
Roam through Gaia
Posted high upon a dark horse
My saddle and my rope is tied to the coach
Dark horse
Gold logo sign on the side of the new chrome Testarossa tires with spokes
Whoever stole my lighter is no
Match for the flame that my dope requires to tote
Indo Flintstone igniter
I smoke
Dovin' ocean holding fire the float
You would choke if you quote what I wrote for writers
Occult oath reciter and potent rhymer
This blunt that I hold the light up is a baton
I composed the choir the notes I spoke is higher
Then vocals of the old Mariah
I would died before I ever tell the coach I'm tired
I won't expire, Covid fighter
My T-cells stay mobile, I'm your phone provider
