I'm not a two-steppin' man, I said, "I do not dance"
It's a gun inside my pants, and the whole world's in his hands (Dance)
It depends, penny for your sins (For your sins)
Shootin' up the block, can't stop revenge (Oh)
Nappy dreadlocks like a rasta man (Rasta man)
Where the story ends and the plot begins
Uh, look, momma said, "The messiah's in moccasins
Tryna save the kids in them apartments
And show a way to live with other options"
Opulence, decadence, black excellence and lots of it
I could cop the newest Bimmer, Bentley or Balenciaga's
I could pay for this lil' nigga scholarship
I ain't caught up in rap nigga politics
Play with me and you playin' yourself
Playin' with death, say him a prayer
Cathy and Carl got a K on the shelf
I'm in DeKalb County open-carryin', caterin', chef
Cookin' up another plate of the best
Me and Christo got it poppin' like it's Crisco
Fried chicken, I'm lickin' her thighs
Then I put my face in her breasts
I took a drive, my plug on the West side
Of Atlanta, he known to finesse guys
With the hammer on Campbellton, headshots
On the camera, knock out a dreadlock
That's a felony charge, he caught a F
Niggas come to the A and get X'd out (Facts)
But I only been here 'cause I'm tryna help
Only one you can help is yourself now
