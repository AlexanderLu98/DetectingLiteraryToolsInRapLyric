Look, I don't ask shit, I just spaz
Ski mask on in the Aston, headed to Bible class
As the water in the streets splash, it's the fiberglass
I classify your last album as weak ass cyber trash
I've amassed so many bodies, I keep bags by the bags
Right or wrong, I'm willing to live or die by the song
Tattoos of my newborn son on my right arm by the psalm
I'm legendary like Iverson
Counting cash, splitting the pie with none
Never will I divide the sum
I'ma just forever be living or die by the gun
Uh, black and white tuxedo, tuck ego, regal Billy Dee though
Touch cheese so cerebral skeezes be like "Fuck me, fuck me mo'"
Uh, prayers up, fuck evil
Either we in the players' club or a cathedral
Up underneath a gazebo, clutch, squeeze, blow
But allow us to begin
That's right, I'm just gettin' started
I got sluts and they lined up for the win
I'ma be 'round here forever
And the only thing falling off is my nut from her chin
Thinking is a nigga time up, then, when?
As I go to lift the blinds up at the wind
Woo, they call a nigga wrecking ball Nickel
No shark swimminâ€™ or dentist'll check a jaw quicker
Product of my mama and papa upper dresser drawer wisdom
If there's a check involved
I disconnect from flaw and then I connect to raw business
Uh, if there's an upper echelon
Then every echelon should know I'm in this
Uh, the air hole on a barrel
Make the TECs so extra long-winded
