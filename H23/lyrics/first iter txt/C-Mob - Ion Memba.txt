Look, some people from the past still living in a mess, so stressed
And they see your life is less grotesque
So they wonder how did you get so blessed?
And their envy is up alas, they will bring up the past
Hoping that you retrogress
That'll make you really wanna check those pests
Mad 'cause you kick it with the best, no less
The divine kind, I define grind 'cause I'm dying trying
Rhymes shine from my mind, I'm like an Einstein from the grime, I'm prime, climb on the timeline
Get better with age every day like a fine wine
But they wanna try to bring back
Memories of when I was a dingbat
Sling crack, do it all for the greenbacks
But I don't remember anything that
They talk to me of debauchery
Well, my bad, my memory's awful, G
Now ease off of me, I think maybe when you see me
You don't wanna be reminded of your mediocrity
You keep stopping me
Bringing up shit to bring me down a notch
'Cause in the past, I been down a lot
But now it goes up and you're hoping that my crown'll drop
And that my sound'll stop, but see, I work hard and hustle
Around the clock, I got the town on lock
Marion, Indiana, you down or not?
Well if so, quit coming around with toxic
Energy, 'cause I'll mentally block it
Talk shit and you can get a snake bite pronto
Tryna fuck with the Snake and Bat, you'll get shit on
Great white guano
