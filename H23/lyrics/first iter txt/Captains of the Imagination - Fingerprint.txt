Yo as I write this
It’s a struggle to be righteous, why trust me?
I don’t even trust myself, I’m just me
Trying to be the best self I can be
Just like you, oh that’s not true?
You think you’re somehow better than me?
When I never made the claim I was better than you?
And the hate that you feel is a hate for yourself
And the greatness you see is the greatness within
If you’re awake you can tell
Everybody’s a community, every soul is a galaxy
Every body is an ecosystem, every mother is an Earth
And the whole universe is a being
And the flow I disperse is a beam
And the road I observe is a dream
Yet the world of my dreams is achieved
When I learn to receive, when I leave
I will earn my desert to redeem
From the dirt to the stream, from the urn to the seed
From the turntable to the DJ, for the tables to turn
And for the slave to be free

How could I ever distance myself from my dreams
I mean I want to live things fully at least make them seem
As beautiful as these pictures and these sceneries
If I don’t make my mind up then I might as well just leave them be
I’m trying to break this silence that is on repeat
Cracking like ice cold let’s just hope this song will speak
For itself, for every book on a shelf
That was never read, a story dead before seeing the light
Better said with the voice of a thousand tongues
Unraveling mysteries until the album comes
Let’s hope tomorrow will be bright, son
Unlimited cards on the table and you’d better pick the right one

Tell me what the scene really needs
Something to supersede what’s already been
Then, tell me what makes a star gleam
When the eye that beholds is so hard to perceive
I’m emerging from the depths of the shadows
Call me master of all the Deathly Hallows
Cheating death with every breath
On the tape deck when I press rec
So say goodbye to all that petty shit
I’m above it all, call me Everest
Say peace and love is my best revenge
Salaam aleikum to my nemesis
Salaam aleikum to my nemesis
If it’s popping off take a sedative
You can shut it up like a denim zip
Won’t hold a grudge, homie let it live
