Watch me, clock me, knock me but don't stop me
I got flocks that watched and got knocked knee properly
I got props from lots of chops it's often got me
Gassed as a motherfucker lost and cocky, what G?
You can't tell me that I don't win
Ca on the beat I'm like a granddad I go in
Unique bredda yeah I got my own ting
You neek, you're not unique with gold rings
I'm a young brother with a lot of heart
Been at it from the start, I can tell you're gonna chart
But how you gonna hold a man when older man ain't half as smart Trying to control a man like Zola can in Upton Park
I'm holding more knowledge than a folder can
I'm focused and you know I love my art
Ain't no more holding grams for Ocean man
Notice that I know my plan
Teedot told me Ropa Dope's a joke you need to go for man
So Ocean goes for man, I owe you fam
Owe you dat, came in the game with a whole new act
Invading the brain with a whole new rap
Blatantly stating that your whole crew's wack
I had to do that, had to man up
If you ain't got the balls to copy then bad luck
You ain't got the balls to copy you fat fuck
You ain't got the balls to copy I'm that much, I got
Exquisite ability mimicking vividest imagery lyrically stinging a killer bee
Killing the similes willyly nillily, wanna be chillin with Fiddy and Diddy
And Cudi the Kidy listening to Biggie
Buming a ciggy with Dizzy and Weezy
Sucking a titty like giggiddy giggiddy, my ability can't mimic me
Flow, buggsy, bigadibobadi
Gota be properly on it to stop a G
Copping the hottest of property, not a monopoly
Actual life, ain't no toppin' me, stoppin' and floppin' is comedy
Honestly quality optical oddities, not in an odyssey
Tell a man straight you've been warned, no wallaby
Ain't feelin' the court, donâ€™t follow G
People we need to abort this policy horribly
Course discographies making me feel like I'm war-ing constantly
Applaud and follow me
I said applaud and follow me
I said applaud and follow me

But I ain't even trying to be that type of guy
Ain't trying to be that type of breh
Ain't tryng to lead that type of life you know
Like I ain't even trying to meet myself a wife
Ain't trying to meet myself no dame
I'm trying to keep myself alright, you know
I feel the sudden rush of heat when I'm on stage
I don't compete with none you pagans
Ca it's peak to fuck with wastemen
My flow is sweet I know the streets they love to taste it
But I'm feelin undertakerish, putting niggas in graves and shit
So ask True Fizz, us man are runnin' shit
But the truth is, these other man are runnin' quick
But if the shoe fits, wear it, and it fits me
See I'm runnin' oh so quickly, so stick me
At the top of the roster where Big be
Big beats got me feeling like twigs in a sandwich I stick to the wrap
No giving it back
I'm flipping a packet of cigs, ripping the cig down the mids
Sprinkling cig on my riz, sprinkling piff on the cig on the riz
Sprinkling cig on the piff on the cig on the riz
Twist it an' get it lit, nigga what?
