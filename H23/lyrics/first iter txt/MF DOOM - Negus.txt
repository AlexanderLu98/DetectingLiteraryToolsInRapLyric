Pa'l carajo, cantaso
Vil', you know the drill, mad drool then gargajo
Shoot the loogie, they super boujee
Gobsmack dab right cheekbone, gooey, groovy, cool
Absolutely yucky, out your league, buddy
Before you take a stab at it, think deep and study
Or get your crown spun around like Black Hawk Down
Surrounded by the natives leakin' hatred till the ground in town
Then freak show, never no beef though
Deepthroat their coquito back and forth then—(Whoosh!)—free throw
Feel the tension, prepare the trenched in henchmen
They all eat quite well; vacations, pensions
Ahem, gotten hoarse from yellin', "Fore!" on the golf course ("Nigga")
Scream boat, then he sped off in a dropped Porsche
DOOM on your hot sauce, take you out to deep water
Group hug, who know the next time you'll see your daughter?
Real slaughter
