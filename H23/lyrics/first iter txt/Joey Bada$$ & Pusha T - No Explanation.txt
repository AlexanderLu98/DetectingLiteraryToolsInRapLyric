Wrote this accompanied by a lil' reefer
My Beats pill speaker (Yeah)
And my two hundred milliliter Hennessey
I hit your lil' chica, told that bitch to ven aquí
Then proceed to bend the knees (Yeah)
I been a G livin' life the way I please
Came from the middle of the East like I'm Lebanese
Bottom line, these MCs lobotomized a thousand times
If we talkin' 'bout their rhyme for rhyme (Yeah)
My stats combined got stocks and bonds
Multiply my worth ten times, by twenty-nine, nigga
I ain't lyin', I'm already on my seventh figure
But I got other things on my mind that's much bigger (Yeah)
Like bein' the voice to this voiceless generation
And fill the void (Right), I can't avoid this temptation
When I exploit, I explode off, detonation
Push my buttons and I go off with no explanation (Haha)

Been in my mind lately, yeah, been in my mind
So hard to define lately, hard to define

You best keep runnin', they tried to hold me back
But I just keep comin' (Yeah), niggas on the Act'
And they just beef runnin' (Push), hit you in them tracks
But it all means nothin' (Yeugh), nothin', nothin'

Cold cases, murder niggas on a daily basis
Luminol flow, no traces
I am the blacklight, my whole career off of crack, right?
Olympic divin' in this money, watch me jackknife
My rap life ain't like yours
I'm really goin' home to five stories and bright walls
Todd James paintings, he said he got my one-of-ones waitin'
Why y'all thinkin' James Evans Jr.?
Four and a half karats of tumor
At Nick Bhindi like Slick Rick the Ruler
Say less about your jewelers
You overpaid for it while bae ignore it
Your shit is just made for TV, thank Draya for it
VIP sections can't be recorded
You might catch a housewife
Where niggas pay 'em like they weigh and drop it outright
Get your count right, we can talk numbers
Single file, add up my digits 'til next summer, niggas

I'm like the Wizard of Oz, on the yellow brick road (Right)
Ride slow with the iron, man (What else?)
New flows for your dome right out the fryin' pan (Right)
Got that free smoke, you inhale through your diaphragm
I'm eatin' now, had to change up my diet plan (Yeah)
Never lyin', I am lion fang
Comin' for the biggest cats in the food chain
Kill 'em all, the only thing left the fools chain
And who to blame?
Is it written raps or ancient artifacts? (Yeah)
And niggas rippin' tracks and spittin' all the facts
Drippin' out my cardiac, arrest is not needed to my body flat
Nah, killin' shows, stackin' bodybags
Catch you where the zombies at
Underground kings, niggas honor that
My forward-thinkin' make 'em all rewind it back (Yeah)
Way ahead of my time, I surpass niggas
This a daily reminder that I am that nigga
Badmon ting
