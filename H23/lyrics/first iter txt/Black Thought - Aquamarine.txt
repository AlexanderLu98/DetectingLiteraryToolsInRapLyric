We go from Lira to Libra, from cold water to fever
To World War III from the treaty signed in Geneva
The biology teacher said we used to be amoebas
The neighborhood preacher said we emerged from the ether
We converged from urethra and struck gold, eurеka
The morning star Tariq, I was born to be a teachеr
Whether scorpion or the frog, the nature of the creature
Is to evolve, though it's the savage beast we truly are
My words should be studied up in Berklee and Juilliard
All my bars is hard as solid gold bullion
My name in the Quran like the kingdom of Suleiman
You done lost your mind trying to call me a moulinyan
'Cause in 2-1-5 where folks fight depression
And wives pack protection, lives lack direction
I'm a king, I'm dipped in God's Black complexion
Survival of the fittest is the natural selection
Now, bear down on the scene like I'm Saladin
The stone courage esteem is aquamarine
You mask how you really feel like it's Halloween
Where they ask how you really feel about my machine
In a class that I'm only in
Alien, horsepower like a Mongolian
Tryna find soul again
But my thoughts corrupt the files that contaminate the console again
It's a shame, but I cannot complain, though I am not the same
My bandwidth is a canvas cut from His frame
When I present ideas, naked and unashamed
It's handwritten in Sanskrit on a 7 Train
