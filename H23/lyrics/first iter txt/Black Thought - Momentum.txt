Yo, when I first started recording, I swore it was more important
To make it to Soul Train in a gold chain and some Jordans
Than makin' my own lane and then blaze in the trail forward
But I came from the old days where the vision was too distorted
To come to an understanding, a partnership and plannin'
For your marketin' and brandin', though the office was abandoned
Am I surprised? I'm monetized like more Morgan Stanley
I'm in a position now to make a difference for the family
My wife, kids, and in-laws deserve Renoirs
Picassos and Warhols distressing my memoirs
About the knowledge of experiences I've endured
Create the bars, full of information like SIM cards
I left court rooms as a defendant, fully acquitted
In spite of the bloodsuckers who try sully my image
And fightin' with motherfuckers who tried to tell me I'm finished
As if I'd ever consider the sky above as a limit
When I am the scientific, my honor, I'm dying with 'em
Iconic, gifted, it's rare and requires a fairly different
Kind of spirit, far as inner feelings, I ain't tryna hear it
Bein' fearless how I'm pioneered into a higher tier
If I am peerless, I guess I am here 'cause ain't nobody near me
On a pyramid and I'm adhering to the game theory
I maintain, momentum and I made a name clearly
But I can't stop, I believe it's no rest for the wary
From the cards I was dealt, to awards on my shelf
I turned scars to a sense of regard for myself
Based on where I set the bar, I made it hard for myself
I lent the hand before my brothers called for my help
When I was still an inspiring, gun right for the firing
Tryna find a part-time job site that was hirin'
Never concerned with the age or the height requirements
Tryna shake the ways of the hood, like the violence
Watchin' the homies being forced into early retirement
I'm stuck as another product of their environment
I was told that achievement of goal starts to tryin' at
The prize, keep your eye on the hard work, rely on it
And nothing else, don't just hustle for your health
Fear they gon' do nothing for you until you secure your wealth
Focus on the top, I've been hot since before crack rock
You out your mind if you think I'ma stop, yo
