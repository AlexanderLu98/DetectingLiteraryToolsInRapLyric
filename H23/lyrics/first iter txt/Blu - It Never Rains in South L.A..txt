We bust shots, cops lost and jealous is them
'Til it's us, puttin' four K down on the rims
Rims swimmin' like fish on the well with the one-ten
Steerin' wheel doin' cartwheels, circle-back again
I'm back again but rain keeps fallin' on my head
Like BJ time before the raw airs, flip later
Haters, hate 'em, gettin' paper shipped by the ship
God stealin' steel still for the shit
Hit the fence and fenders goin' against you
Won't get past the fence defense
We in the trench back in Cali like a army in the trench
Trim fifth of Hen, no restraint, nine mil' clip
Move nine inch leave you nailed to the fence
Intense, I get lit times ten when I'm tense
I'm ever tense, I'm always lit like July get
Right before the fifth on 5th with the spliff on hit
Thinkin' 'bout stayin' out, not gettin' hit
'Cause they say

It never rains in southern Los Angeles, uh
Where shots pop and put fear on the block
And they say that when it rains it's the tears of God, but

Los Angeles
Killa Cal or Cali, countin' a milli', makin' the money
Movin' snow 'til you so high you fall like hell
My nigga said he fell so heavy he fell into Hell
Heaven, help homies finance homes, finance business
Finance bitches, fine-ass hoes, fightin' fire
Flyin' when the Swisher Sweet meet my lighter
Smoked out, coke Coke bottle models come out
My model's kinda like fire, ice, hot but it's cold
Suraros die, pop the four-five Glock for the cold
Cash be movin' so fast niggas pull out they heat
Blast to keep food on the table, fridge cold with the stove
More kitchen met wet with the rock and roll
Got four shots for them hoes cockblockin' my flow
Block to block got blocks, chop the rock, yeah
Rob and stole sold dope, coke powder and pop at foes
Foes pop back, po-pos pop at the back of your dome

It never rains in southern Los Angeles, uh
Where shots pop and put fear on the block
And they say that when it rains it's the tears of God, but

Los Angeles time, time with the rhyme on my mind
Ridin' with the nine, nine times outta ten a ten is a dime
Penny-pinchin' niggas pinchin' the dimes, oldest business
Is show business and hoes won't show you they times
Time change, five gold chains changed in the times
Return to Trump, mind on my money, money on my mind
My own property mine, robbery, crime not stoppin' me, mom
Open my blinds blind, somebody's watchin' me all the time
FBI, CIA, PVs and private eyes
IRS checkin' on me with the tech
By they side crime fighters with no crime to fight
Invent a crime, homicide, suicide, shoot the youth and sigh
Swear I'll protect ya mom, by any means means you choose a side
Black suits on that black on black red and blue sirens
Youth forgot about the truth in '92, but it's fine
The Bloods spilled blood and blues choose who's that blew out your mind

It never rains in southern Los Angeles, uh
Where shots pop and put fear on the block
And they say that when it rains it's the tears of God, but
