Ain't no explainin' my rhythm, he can't explain how I did him
Sayin' my name is a given, can't see the pain 'cause it's hidden
Never had love for the weak, they only see danger in livin'
I put these drugs on these streets, they put the 'caine in they system
Foes see to cut up my teeth, but still not obtaining my wisdom
I don't' see nothin' but grief, the shit puttin' pain in my vision
I don't want nothin' but peace, but still I remain in this prison
Always gon' land on my feet, I pivot and change my position
And if we want you deceased, we ain't gon' change our decision
Niggas will plan for defeat, 'cause they ain't gon' train for the mission
I did my thing in the kitchen, slang 'till it came to fruition
You'll do the same if you listen, 'cause we got the same inhibitions
And if this came to attrition, I'll blow your brains with the Smith-en
They'll find your frame when they fishin' I am insane with these writtens
My shit remains a religion, whether you raised as a Christian
Baptist or atheist livin', I'm not a slave to your fiction
I've seen the marks of the beast, while walkin' the darkest of streets
It's why we don't talk to police, 'cause power's a painless addiction
Now could you name a musician willing to change the conditions
I'll break the law for my peace, y'all niggas just came for submission
I never pray for permission, drive that'll break the ignition
See through the heart of a priest, I think you should brace for collision
