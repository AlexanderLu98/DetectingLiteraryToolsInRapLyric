Magnificent, it been evident with this microphone
He been my ace boon coon, then again I might be wrong
I felt myself parting with who I started with
Fuck the skills, this is all from the heart and shit
This life I live, fighting and shooting
It’s polluting my mind, but I turned out fine
We used to strangle and smash, mangle and blast
Although we was opposites we was Tango & Cash
But it ain’t gonna last
We was equals with the lyrics
Whatev's homes, It ain’t your skin tone, it's in your spirit, hear it
First, I’m your boy since way back
We all fought the wheel of fortune, but don’t say jack
When you turned your back on your crew
Who was down with you?
Looking Tice in a woody
Tune to your hoodie
I’m from the Mob but not the Goodie
The name is Dirty Dozen, never meant to see you footie
So don’t step and wear it out
I’m calling you, was sold in the moon
So comprehend, the message I send
F-R-I to the friend, a friend to the end let’s begin
