Like a Shaolin astoundin', pound grounds like mountains
Bouncin', be the largest nigga, pounds and ounces
Well-rounded like cursive, my verses birth inertia
Converge and surge, hurt and burn ya
Philosophical, spit prodigal, son quantical
Known to bust a clip and swift kick right at your opticals
In a hot pursuit, I split particles, follicles rift
Punches hit with nautical drifts, spark up the spliff
Chris Samurai, mesmerized, strikes cleaner than sanitize
You fantasize, real, couldn't show it more if I pantomime
Bronx symphony, stomp lyrically, chomp bitch MCs
Earn mine, wouldn't even give you niggas my sympathies
Feelin' me? Said you feelin' me, you niggas feelin' heat
Brave hearted, you leave departed like Hawk's enemies
Marvel, marvelous, my art is bliss
If you ain't the nicest, you a target, bitch
