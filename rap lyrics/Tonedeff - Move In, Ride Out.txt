Yo, I hit em up with a bit of a touch
Of atypical lyrical visual cinema
When I set up in the thick of the rhythm I get em intox-I-cated
Its not complicated I made this one of a kind
Run of a rhyme, to stun or to blind, fly women from the front or behind
If they stuck in the line, its something to find
I ain't stubborn to spend, but this one brother been, hunting for dimes
I pluck em in time, the second I get a chance to
Hittin the backroom, in the mid of the song we dance through
Bashful? Never That/ High Maintenance? Send her Back
This track for the broke as fuck cats that's with the better raps
Seven women stacked in our laps
Figured that we were prized with Kentucky Fried Chicken Dinner Packs
Is it a fact? Oh yes indeed
T successfully brings the best recipe
