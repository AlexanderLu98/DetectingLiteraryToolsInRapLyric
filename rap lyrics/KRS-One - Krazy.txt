Kris is the Pharaoh, with bow and a arrow
We double the barrel gorilla apparel
The mightiest pharaoh don't think of a battle
My lyrics is comin' so crazy
Spittin' immaculate the actual factual front to the back of you
Clappin' and crackin' you hackin' the mac for you
Look at them laugh at you
Lyrics is coming so crazy
Spittin' with me now you see what I am teaching
Your mind I am reaching with all that I'm teaching
That love and that peace and it never will weaken the truth I am speaking is crazy
Truth I am speaking get used to repeating
The youth I am reaching
With proof of this teachin' I speak for a reason
So they can beliеve in the truth of MCin' it's crazy
Crackin' the back of thеse rappers
I'm passin' these actors, I'm faster
Spittin' metal natural rippin' clubs forever
We be coming better, spreading love forever, crazy
You hearing a pro, I'm spittin' the flow that you know
Higher level thinking I come to show
Knowledge of self is a thing you must know
You see what they playing, they steady betraying
The culture we making, exploiting and taking
Look at them faking what we are creating
Now you mistakin' what's real and what's fakin'
This thing they do for the money they making
They sell out their people, their culture, their nation
Sell out their soul for a radio station
So they could be playing in heavy rotation
You see what I'm saying, our culture they taking
But that's not enough, it's our spirit they breaking
And only the culture can see what I'm saying
'Cause only the culture will see them betraying
You see what they playing, you see what they saying
And you can not see us, our people they slaying
Well, maybe you do, and then maybe you don't
And then maybe you will and then maybe you won't
But it's our community, that's who's at hope of
The greed and the crime and the police are chokin'
The TV is playin' that okely-doke while our people are dyin'
You seein' them choke with that cheatin' and lyin'
They tellin' our people, now this is they hope
But did anything change with the last vote?
The time before that did we pass something?
All we've been getting is Chapter 11
While racists with weapons are shooting our reverends
A message from Heaven with all that you getting
Get understanding, overstanding this lesson
With all of the blingin' and cash that you getting
You stumble for sure it's the poor you neglecting
The thieves and the liars they all in your section
I'm bringing my people in different directions

Crazy
My lyrics is crazy
I'm coming so crazy
Ha, they must be crazy

Yo, So here goes another my sisters and brothers
It's obvious KRS ain't like these others
I've been out the bed while they under the covers
I spit off the head while they babble and stutter
Not three and not two but the one is my number
I'm spitting my written I tour every summer
With every year I get younger and younger
But some want to doubt and continue to wonder, is crazy
They continue to blunder, is crazy
They continue to slumber
What I'm teaching is what I'm expressing
I'm teaching the streets that the mind is a weapon
Like anything you can perceive in perception
It's what you will manifest all in your section, it's crazy
Set up your own direction, crazy
Don't get caught up on complexion, crazy
This is that reason I'm spitting and books getting written
'Cause you be forgetting, it's crazy
