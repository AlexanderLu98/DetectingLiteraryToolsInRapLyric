D-D-D, d-damn, said I'm back again
To whoop ass, the blicka blast from the ratchet, man
The maddest, blackest lad in a savage land
Of grab and dash and crash in your daddy's van
D-D-D, d-d, bad as the most having-est
Most swaggiest, braggy as never had anythin'
So I'm mackin' as if I never had shit
Eyes movin' backwards, I coulda' hit a backflip, check this
I ain't never hustle for a necklace
Tryna get the fam' straight, get us out of debt, shit
That shit get testy, huh, I feel Dizzy Gillespie
In the room packed, me, Carl, Izzy, and Precious
Out the womb, I was last, I'm the youngest of seven
Birthday same day as the reverend, birthday same day as the devil
Black lock like the pot and the kettle
Wreck shop, a monotonous fellow
Lick a shot for the nigga tryna stop the journey
JID pull up on a opp like, "What's poppin', Kermit?"
Blocka blocka, operate, doctor, surgery
IVs, gurneys, shit bag, gone for eternity, hey
More the merrier, more to come murder me, hey
Close the casket, commonly courtesy, hey
Headshots too personal for a burglary, ooh
Red dots 'cause killers could close curtain me
I done did wrong, someone send me up vertically
Horizontally, read me a passage from Deuteronomy
Anything you can do to conquer the demon inside of me
Any meaning the truth and the Father, the spirit guided me
I can bleed in the booth and leave a tooth as a souvenir
For who was here, and if you hearing it
You know the spirit is imperative, imperative, imperial
Black man pyramid, the peer of men, jackman with the gat
Scratching off the serial, sack man, get the pack
Money in the envelope, pissing down the urinal
Ass man in the strip club, tell her bend it over
Gon' give it to her, she been workin' for it, hey
You gon' make a nigga cop a Birkin for you, hey
You the bomb, look, I got a turban for you, bae
Beat a nigga 'til he color purple for you, babe
I'ma murder for you, bae, 730 for you, ayy

Odd Toddler, murderer, Madara, moniker
Zeltron slither in, python, right on
Right on cue, write, Sun Tzu
Kill you, vehicle swerves on you
Serves you right, you lose sight like demolish
Break it down, build it up, then re-polish
Like toenails on Odell with shoe deals that never, ever go well
Take no Ls 'cause I am not Noel
Bitch, the name's Denzel
The flames exhale, my pain's on braille
You feel it? Similar to fish in a skillet
Hook and a line intertwined when I reel it like films
Movie groovy, jinkie, Scooby
Very spooky, soul is black as Moolies
Talk like Pootie, I spit fire, loogies
Comin' off the kufi with the blues, no Tookie
So many y'alls, I'm bored, there's too many yawns
I got a lot of green, that's too many lawns
I'm still hot 'til I set in the dawn, until a nigga rockin' Saint Laurent
We go together like Harry and Ron
Treat the microphone as same as a wand
Magic maxi pad (Ah, yeah)
Denzel lusts for blood, I grab the MAG
Made you half a man but not a Sag'
Flow is ugly, time to bust a sag
Clint Eastwood, I killed the good and bad
Oh my God, would you look at that? How to kill a ego
JID and Zel, Scorpion to Sub-Zero
