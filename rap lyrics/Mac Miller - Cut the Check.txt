I'm a motherfuckin' fool (Yeah), cut the check
I'm a workin' motherfucker, need a desk, shit
I don't got a heart, I don't even need a chest
I'm a mess, they be sayin' they up next, that's a stretch
Hold your breath, let me bow to the crowd, shit, I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table, gin rummy
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfuckin' great time
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s
I'm a motherfuckin' fool, cut the check
I'ma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get
No stress, runnin' suicides, don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You gettin' fucked by your contract, what the fine print says
Told you once; I told you twice; I get the lamb; it's over rice
I whip the Lamb, it's overpriced, the life is goodâ€”the hoes are dykes
This type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfuckin' fool
