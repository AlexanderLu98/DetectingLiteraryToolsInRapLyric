June 20th a Gemini is born
Ain't no secret I'm murdering anything I get on
Ain't no reason for surgery, silence, so we can mourn
I literally leave a murder scene every time I perform
It's a state of emergency, been a bit of a disturbance, see
Artists showin' no courtesy, rap is out of its form
Should be locked up for perjury, lyin' about what you're doin'
Sellin' your soul for currency, anything to get on
Hell is for an eternity, hope you know where you're goin'
An industry full of wannabes, never will I conform
I'm light years ahead of you rappers that started flowin'
And half of the ones that got it don't even know what they doin'
You write a rap and it's wack, it's the rappers that you influence
So backwards half of the time, don't know if you're comin' or goin'
Your lack of passion for rap is the reason rap has been ruined
The fashion is where your passion is, that's what you should be doin'
They claim they cut from the fabrics that they paint in their drawings
But as soon as they get to eatin' you're back and touchin' your groin, so
Riddle me, riddle me, how many rappers physically
Drizzle with the ability, that can mess with me lyrically
Mimic or even mirror me, hell will freeze over literally
Wildebeest with the similes, metaphors and agility
Little you to belittle me, jealous of what I'm willed to be
Still a beast with the killer speech
If it's mental then it'll be typically easy as me on top of this instrumental beat
I'm a problem, admit it you scared, Imma make it hard to eat
Still a gorilla killer, retardedly solemnly swore that I would go get it scared
Well you oughta be called a priest if he really should kill a prayer and prophecy
Follows me through the wilderness, Father put me where I should be
