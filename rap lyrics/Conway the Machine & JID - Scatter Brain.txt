Packs in the mail, packs on the road
Connect FaceTimed, said he just hid the last of my load
The shit on my neck, that come from the packs that I sold
I never went Platinum or Gold (Hah)
You still fuck with him and you know he a rat and he told (Huh?)
Love when a nigga talk stupid
'Cause that's when shots run him down and he clappin' his pole (Brrt)
Trust me, that doesn't bode well for a nigga, it's gon' be victims (Boom)
I'm a street nigga, boy, you know the difference
Hand around the throat of the rap game
And I'm boa constrictin' (Choke), my soul is missin' (Choke)
In the top spot, I got sole position, man, this ho was trippin' (Woo)
She think I wanna taste her pussy (Woo, woo)
I ain't tastin' shit like a COVID symptom
I'ma social distance, bitch (Hah, look)

I got no resistance with a Colt .45 gold edition
I'm a dope magician
Niggas disappearin' if I hear 'em dissin'
Kill a engineer and kill a nigga mixin'
In the 6, niggas still flippin' Nixon
Second strike, they finna Billy Clint' 'em
Red and white, he got the blues
Turn him into food, everybody grip a biscuit
Runnin' lights inside of city limits
I'm excited, my lil' shawty, she the shit
And we inside of somethin' simple with suicidalâ€”
Finish the sentence
Door close, chop the head off a chicken
Morse code, if I'm talkin', I'm clickin'
Lights flicker, tell 'em, "Hold your position"
Money-motivated, mind on a mission
Straps in the lap and the pack, got a lock
On the back of the cabinet doors
I lit a match for the torch in the game
For the real niggas only, the fake get exposed
Scrapin' the plate, breakin' the bowl
Makin' it shake, takin' it home
I'm in the A with a 'K, so come on if you crazy
Cold-ass world, goin' out, guns blazin'
Fuck is you niggas sayin'?

Goin' out, guns blazin'
Cold-ass world, niggas get done flagrant
World gone mad, even my son vaping
I'm in my bag, nigga, I'm done playin' with you
Gettin' rich off za like it's base in the '80s
Spot jumpin' like Tracy McGrady (Huh?)
Ten chains on, nigga's face lookin' crazy
I still get a paycheck from Shady, ah
