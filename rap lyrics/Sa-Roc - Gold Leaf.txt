The last born from out the asphalt and city dust
Now my life look like it was cast from the cinemas
I'm teaching class for the mass rap illiterate
Each of my rivals gasp when they glance at my syllabus
I be spitting math plus a fraction of literature
F with both subjects so I guess I'm polygamous
Beauty and the beast, homie, please don't bring the beef
Babydoll when I'm peace, if I'm upset, then I'm hideous
These double Xs got me extra saucy
See, Red linking with that gold and green like Selassie
'Cause everybody jumping on my space age philosophy
My tapes got em hopping out the Matrix like Ferraris
Well, I'm the modern day Almoravid
And my involvement can civilize a savage in eighty bars
It's why there's a following in every quadrant
'Cause Roc is cooking something lovely in the cauldron
