King! I'm about to do my shit, Hop, I'm about to do my hip-hop
Where I rap and wear my diamond studded flooded wristwatch
And fuck your bitch in Gucci flip flops
I get two groupies and I just watch
I make them bitches coochie lip lock
They think I'm awesome, Poppa's groovy
But this ain't a fuckin' movie, get with the movin' the move
If you're goofy, I'ma make the fuckin' scripts swap
I'm at the tip top of my game though, and my chain glow
Like I found the gold at the end of the rainbow
I heard your girl take five then take five then take five more
Like Jackie, Tito, Marlon, Michael and Jermaine though
And that's your main ho?
I heard he did the robot in the whole twat
The whole damn time you was thinkin' that whole thing lined
They had it lookin' like the "Soul Train" line
Choose up, elevate, move up
Maneuver, juice up, you suck, manure, you suck
My newer use of dudes who exclude us
Including Judas, fool, we exude
Upper echelon, the upper at your mosque
Fuck it, bet your broad done took off with your car
Sucker, bet you'd call the cops and cop a deuce
I cop a squad on niggas, cock a chopper too
Take the masses off a pile of Jabbawockeez
Keep the ratchets on me, keep you ratchets off me
Keep you actors back, peep the acrobat, niggas flip the script
People have your back or have your back in caskets
Bastards once you die, that's it, once you lie
I'll cut you off like you drop your black ass in acid
Won't you fry?
Won't you buy a skirt and heels and twerk for bills?
'Cause everybody's a bitch if you ask me
Haha, yup, and we the strongest boys
I done been considered the best for like the longest, boy
I got pissed off and hopped on the phone with Royce
"Yo Los, what up my nigga?"
"Mm, shit, uh, man, I need a favor from the god"
"Nigga you the GOAT, nigga anything you need, what's good?"
"Okay, then this won't be hard
I need that two minute unlimited of you and Eminem
"Bad Meets Evil" sequel, eye for an eye
Fetty Wap, Masika, secret technique
Street meets perfectionist, unique eclecticness (Royce!)
I need that why the fuck do Akademiks
Keep postin' all the wackest rappin' gimmicks?
I got a platinum plaque in Swag Olympics back in the day"
I be bumpin' Fab' in Brooklyn, I be bumpin' Fab in the Bay
Just cashed a six figure check, that's called a fabulous day
Miraculous, practice this, after this, they gon' hashtag them to pray
But half of 'em tagged as my prey
Immaculate passion to pass, I'm surpassin' the Jays
The Biggie and Pacs, 'cause that's what they would want
To give me the shot, the Nas's gave us knowledge
Pun gave us puns, once they was done
They would want the one that was finna take it
Know you pussy niggas really finna hate it
This my inner sanctum, this ain't entertainment
And this shit a movie and they finna tape it
Morpheus, Neo, agents in "The Matrix"
And it's ancient and it's painted on the wall of the pyramids
Fuck all y'all!
