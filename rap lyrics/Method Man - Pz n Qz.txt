I got a Ghostface Killah train the Gio, Gorillaz on Nat Geo
Pushin' P at the PO, the only fare is the RICO
We know this here is primo, that snap necks, nonio
No keno, you can bet that I got necks, nosino (Uh-uh)
Now, follow the credo, gambinos, and pink flamingos
The casino, with some guidos who sippin' on casamigos
Qué rico me amigo, dem tranquilo like muy frio
Pardon my lingo, but OMG, ’’Ayy, ¡Dios mío!'’
My method lethal, a little bit um Paquito
Fittin' all inside Palico, I leave you finished beneath though, uh
The meal plan is a million bands, no key though
And freedom with no ''M’', should tell you nothin' for free though
That's wild boy, no Steve-O, magnetism, magneto (Uh)
A star lord, but people gon' tell you it's just my ego
Or, my black machismo ,Or my black machismo, known for the speaker
That's the keynote, these rappers out here whinin', that's the Pino, That's the pino
