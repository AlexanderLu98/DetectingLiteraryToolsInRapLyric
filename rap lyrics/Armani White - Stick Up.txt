They got me flagged, I even fucked around and got illuminati mad
My chipping tooth keep slipping through the sloppy mask
They spot me as
The ring leader, king me, them niggas get they Rodney ass
Whooping, shotty blast and then rotisserie the body bag
Double piece shorties, I checker and paint the victim & stick her
The bigger the lick then the bigger the dinner yo ligament ripping it ricochet
Rivet and ridged a rib an original riddick yo ribbon ain't shit
A lieutenant get ten if yo tenant attending he tending yo tent & attempting to back up!
They tripping off of acid still give him a chance to pass the steel
And rap yo cypher blasting, the passenger gotta grab the wheel
I crashed the lambo at the packer field, kidnap him
I pad the wall and grip a tablet and crack the glass across that bastard’s grill
Show up with bandolier and strap around the chest
I’ll hand the pistol to your face and still clap when i’m impressed fucking clown
