No Walter White, but I'm breaking bad
Mazeltov, breaking glass
Make a path, I make 'em roadkill on one tank of gas
Take a drag in TGI Friday with a Jason mask
Problem is y'all don't see the problem, let me take a stab at it
Slash at it, bunch of fiends and rap addicts
I'm just tryna break to leave and you can't even break a habit
This ain't rap, this is black magic, back on that package
Two straps on 'em like backpackers, now back to rappers
You backstabbers, right back at ya
And backtracking so cliché
But nothing's more cliché than black rapper
What's the fact of what comes after laughter?
Y'all wasn't factoring the fact we ain't laughing with ya, we laughin' at ya
Mef your master, silverback, overachiever
My chef black and he whip crack like overseer
I blow the cheeba, my index finger can blow the heater
And the track mixed with that cocaina, I blow the speaker (Yeah)
