A-yo, spark up the Phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick, money grip, 'fore yo' ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightnin'
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? A'ight, then!
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparin' yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolet
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm sayin' hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah! 'Cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw 'em, they come back
I'm comin' straight out the NYC
I'm down with Diggin' In The Crates, and I'm MVP
