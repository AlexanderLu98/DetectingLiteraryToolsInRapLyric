The phase I'm on, love, I wouldn't believe it either
I'd be like, "JAY-Z's a cheater," I wouldn't listen to reason either
All I know is E's a felon, how is he sellin'?
Weed, the Caliva brothers, deep down, I believe you love us, huh
Feast your eyes, the piece unique, it's sapphire
Rappers liars, I don't do satire
Neither I nor my wrist move mockingly
Y'all spend real money on fake watches, shockingly
They put me on lists with these niggas inexplicably
I put your mansion on my wall, are you shittin' me?
I blew bird money, y'all talkin' Twitter feed
We got different Saab stories, save your soliloquies
They like, "If BIG was alive, Hov wouldn't be in his position"
If BIG had survived, y'all would have got The Commission
Hov was gon' always be Hov
It 'twas the universe will 'cause Allah said so, and now I'm here
