Niggas ain't see what I saw, a brick turn into a pot full of gold
Over that, spent my daughter first birthday locked in the hole
Plot full of holes, came back stronger, I'm in control
Soft white from my block to the stove, not in a cone (Nah)
Me and West like Stockton, Malone, Gotti, Capone
Niggas dressed like they copyin' hoes, papi, come on
Stop it, you know you not with the smoke, I get you loafed (Brrr)
In 'bout a year, how niggas gon' deny me the throne? (Huh)
Rappers y'all compare me to, niggas scared of me too (Niggas shook)
It make they heart beat faster just hearin' the truth (Have your heart beat, nigga)
I stick my .40 out the window while I'm steerin' the coupe (Uh huh)
We pull up to your front door if I'm hearin' to shoot (Let's go)
They say we sold dope and did random actions of violence
Our neighbors in the 'burbs wanna hand us back to the projects
They say I'm on tour while the Family package the product (Uh uh)
Everybody gon' eat and I'm standin' next to that promise
Can't believe y'all when y'all talk about the guns y'all shot (Can't believe that shit)
And all the money runnin' to 'em and it's crumbs y'all got
Just let me know, come check with me when y'all want y'all shot
It's ten shooters in my hood for every one y'all got
Ayy, look, I had to dumb it down for niggas, you gotta do that (Sometimes)
It's like bringin' down the prices, you gotta move that
I was in the Feds with braids under the durag
I'ma volunteer to do ya if it come to that (Uh)
I fuck with smart bitches, in the club, I caught bitches starin' (Yeah)
All these jewels got these hoes' train of thought slippin', ah
Brought a quarter thing back, that's a small mission
In the dark kitchen, all you hear is the fork clickin' (Woo)
In the zone, lookin' through the holes of them yard fences
I'm dope, yeah, you know the flow from them park benches (Uh)
Three things happen when you keep your torch, nigga
Put in work, you might sell it, or you gon' get caught with it
