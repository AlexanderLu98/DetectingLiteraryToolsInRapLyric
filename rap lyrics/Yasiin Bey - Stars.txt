Your chain hangin', bling swingin', back breakin'
But it's gleamin', problem posture, double cup leanin'
Slide, slouchin' tiger, pimpin' dragon on swagger
VVS is very vertebrae snappin', lights flashin'
A manicured appearance concealin' the shattered spirit
Jinn sneerin' out the paradox prism
The palace as the prison, retail religion
Red carpet constriction, the freedom is the fiction
As niggas raised specific is race really existin'
Man, get the bag, you're trippin'
Go 'head partner, hit this, sip this
Wishlist, hitlist, top ten, shit list, bitchless
Chickless, playmate, playboy, flip sides, same coin, big front
But no joy, yuck, oh boy, hot girls, cold hearts
Tax man like the Taliban and ISIS
No relation to class of Osiris
Kissin' cousins 'til the climbin' gas prices kill a climate
Yikes-es, sucker, mean muggin', who the nicest?
A promised death known is what they life is
Bey tap in, they tap out like a tabloid typist
They touch too tiny to the titan, YA-S-double I-N
Conquerin' lion out the liar, seek the garden, flee the fire
