Welcome to the guild it’s a synagogue get involved
Journeyman with a sturdy hand when I’m pennin' bars
Dirty plan like a dirty man during intercourse
Healer to the sinners during pentecost cold
Winner in a winter with a little frost and a talk of a rented Porsche
Horsepower of a minotaur in a little car going really far
Five
Kindergarten top Colonel on a block with a pitstop
Locked in a concrete spot you cannot hurdle
Polo top hot cuz we’re running from the game and the Robocops
Cuz he got a 40 block cocked for my top like I’m not fertile
Government block buying Arizona plots taking pictures
With a satellite shot
Just to crop circles in the middle of the picture making crop circles
Cinco
Ferraris with the tints
Park it by the bench in the projects
It’s a project to project when I market to the Penske
Following the blimps hot
Hot air, I’m there
The Department of Defense
Pentagon
Five sides to the body if you squint real hard
Morphology to the S is the worst squint
Now you gotta quint, hmm
That’s five, right?
Dark night on the Harley with a quinn
Smooth Gemini
Look even Harley got a dent two sides
Teach you how to rob, not like 50 cent
Teach you how to rob you could probably be the Grinch
Sleeping on me now you gotta get a pinch
Or you gotta get a kick till the top doesn’t spin
Inception
You can call me Cobb if we friends
Leonardo got a twin
I’m a prodigy of Prince
Wreak havoc on your prodigy again
All city chess prodigy
Bobby with the pen
Five moves and you check
I got the word play locked
Doing thirty in the third lane
With a mermaid giving bird brain top
Make an earthquake stop on Thursday, bop!
