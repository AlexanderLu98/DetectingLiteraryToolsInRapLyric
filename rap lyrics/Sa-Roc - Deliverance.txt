If I could get a taste of my freedom, I would savor every tidbit
Pilot planes like I was Tuskegee
The flyest letterman, call me collegiate
That's why I get violent on these mics
Can turn a phrase like Ike and Tina
Stories bloodied and beaten so well, we're calling 'em red tales, how convenient, facts
The struggle I know left physical scars as lasting proof
Mommy and pops residual trauma pushed them to bottles, Absolut
Homie, that '90s era was rocky, had to be sly and outfox the coop
Everyone knows a rose can grow from cracks, but most don't blossom fruit
So my lyrical watts like miracle drops, BB, I'm Posdnuos
That's De La from the soul
I'm undersold and over hip-hop to boot
They worship green like God
Got bands to ear like radio's top ten grooves
My samples clear, I push gems like DeBeers
No conflict, just the truth
See, I'm the plug
I'm giving the people the power, try not to blow out the fuse
I'm so close to these lower and upper cases that I guess that it's best I recuse
Telling me I need to party and bullshit to win
Well then, homie, I guess I'ma lose
Ain't no biggie, I'm black obsidian
Rap's new Gideon, summon the troops
