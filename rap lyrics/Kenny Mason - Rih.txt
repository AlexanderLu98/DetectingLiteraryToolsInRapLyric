I show you the technique
I show you the TEC, freeze
I know the effects, my nigga that catch plays, want me to set screens
Sort of like tech geeks, I accept my homie that bet games havin' his best week
I'm tryna invest, I may not be as street as the next
But live on the next street, ho don't test
Stick with the red beam, Boba Fett
Stick with no Ed Reed on defense
That mean the safety off it, yes
Even with AC, got 'em sweatin'
Thinkin' we ain't eating gotta say, even for KD, that's a stretch
Makin' it seem like it's eight feet but this shit really ain't' deep
Niggas pressed, came from the same scenes
In the city that gave me Gucci, Thugger and Fresh
Made dreams of becomin' the best
Ain't seem like that far of a fetch

A-li-en, I'm R-rated like my name Rih-unapologetic
It's a seat at the top of this shit
They saved me, bitch and I'm finna sit
