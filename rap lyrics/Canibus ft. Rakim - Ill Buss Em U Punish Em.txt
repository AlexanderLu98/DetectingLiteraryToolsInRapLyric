Be ready and at your best, the Celebrity Match of Death
Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath
Then I ask the ref, "How many cats is left?"
One-on-one, who challengin'? Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishin' kids
Abdomen punctured in, look what I done to his wig
Wanna live? Then I stab 'em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at, any place, any time
Get your snot-box smashed with a nine, smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain what it's like seein' your brain
You insane, who's gonna ID the remains?
And then I reincarnate 'em, and kill 'em again
Again and again, again and again, c'mon

Yo! Yo! Yo! he started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair
So I grabbed a handful and chopped him in the Adam's apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So I'mma twist 'em up like a pretzel then I'mma tag you
I'm on some Stone Cold shit, warn your whole clique
Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split
Who wanna spit? Bang 'em quick, strangle 'em wit' his lip
Try to flip, leave his body danglin' by his hip
Ra, you left him danglin', I can't believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like I'm dancin' with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snap him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10
Seven birds make 'em swerve 'til they vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb
Then stick my dick in your ear, and fuck what you heard!
