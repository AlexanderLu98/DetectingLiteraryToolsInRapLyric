I'm daft
I battle all like I don't have it all
Avant-garde
Battlestar Galactica
Got rhymes per capita
I'm shining through the aperture
But I'm not gonna bust no caps for ya (nah)
That's another genre
I'm the black bomber
Track charmer
Sack burner
Distract burdens
If it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints
Word sentinel invisible infidel interstellar
Hella clever
Endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail cause you average
Regardless of your sales and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a Landcruiser
Down MacArthur
Artistic archer
Autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Ichabod
I infuriated, tick you off
Stick to Pop
Hip-Hop's too difficult
To me, it's a cult
Lyrics lacerated, slit cha throat
Beat cha brain down like Piscopo when sniffin' coke
I don't know, Diff'rent Strokes
So respect me 'fore I whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testes
Purposely improve you just to see who the best be
But sold up sexy
Take a poll to know the prestige
What?
Large lefty (Yeah)
I automate
Animate
My soul sanitation like I gotta canvas painting
Manifestations
